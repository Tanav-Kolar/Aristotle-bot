    "text": "Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and pursuit, is\nthought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly\nbeen declared to be that at which all things aim. But a certain difference\nis found among ends; some are activities, others are products apart from\nthe activities that produce them. Where there are ends apart from the\nactions, it is the nature of the products to be better than the activities.\nNow, as there are many actions, arts, and sciences, their ends also are\nmany; the end of the medical art is health, that of shipbuilding a vessel,\nthat of strategy victory, that of economics wealth. But where such arts\nfall under a single capacity—as bridle-making and the other arts con-\ncerned with the equipment of horses fall under the art of riding, and this\nand every military action under strategy, in the same way other arts fall\nunder yet others—in all of these the ends of the master arts are to be\npreferred to all the subordinate ends; for it is for the sake of the former\nthat the latter are pursued. It makes no difference whether the activities\nthemselves are the ends of the actions, or something else apart from the\nactivities, as in the case of the sciences just mentioned.",

Will not the\nknowledge of it, then, have a great influence on life? Shall we not, like\narchers who have a mark to aim at, be more likely to hit upon what is\nright? If so, we must try, in outline at least, to determine what it is, and\nof which of the sciences or capacities it is the object. It would seem to\nbelong to the most authoritative art and that which is most truly the\nmaster art. And politics appears to be of this nature; for it is this that\nordains which of the sciences should be studied in a state, and which\neach class of citizens should learn and up to what point they should\nlearn them; and we see even the most highly esteemed of capacities to\nfall under this, e.g., strategy, economics, rhetoric; now, since politics\nuses the rest of the sciences, and since, again, it legislates as to what we\nare to do and what we are to abstain from, the end of this science must\ninclude those of the others, so that this end must be the good for man.\nFor even if the end is the same for a single man and for a state, that of\nthe state seems at all events something greater and more complete whether\nto attain or to preserve; though it is worth while to attain the end merely\nfor one man, it is finer and more godlike to attain it for a nation or for\ncity-states. These, then, are the ends at which our inquiry aims, since it\nis political science, in one sense of that term.",

    "text": "Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the sub-\nject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike in all\ndiscussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now fine\nand just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much\nvariety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist\nonly by convention, and not by nature. And goods also give rise to a\nsimilar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before\nnow men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by\nreason of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such\nsubjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in\noutline, and in speaking about things which are only for the most part\ntrue and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are\nno better. In the same spirit, therefore, should each type of statement be\nreceived; for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in\neach class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is\nevidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathema-\ntician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.\nNow each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a\ngood judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a\ngood judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round\neducation is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper\nhearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the\nactions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are\nabout these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study\nwill be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge\nbut action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or\nyouthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his\nliving, and pursuing each successive object, as passion directs. For to\nsuch persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to\nthose who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle knowl-\nedge about such matters will be of great benefit.\nThese remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be ex-\npected, and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our preface.",

    "text": "Let us resume our inquiry and state, in view of the fact that all knowl-\nedge and every pursuit aims at some good, what it is that we say politi-\ncal science aims at and what is the highest of all goods achievable by\naction. Verbally there is very general agreement; for both the general\nrun of men and people of superior refinement say that it is happiness,\nand identify living well and doing well with being happy; but with re-\ngard to what happiness is they differ, and the many do not give the same\naccount as the wise. For the former think it is some plain and obvious\nthing, like pleasure, wealth, or honour; they differ, however, from one\nanother—and often even the same man identifies it with different things,\nwith health when he is ill, with wealth when he is poor; but, conscious of\ntheir ignorance, they admire those who proclaim some great ideal that is\nabove their comprehension. Now some thought that apart from these\nmany goods there is another which is self-subsistent and causes the good-\nness of all these as well. To examine all the opinions that have been held\nwere perhaps somewhat fruitless; enough to examine those that are most\nprevalent or that seem to be arguable.\nLet us not fail to notice, however, that there is a difference between\narguments from and those to the first principles. For Plato, too, was\nright in raising this question and asking, as he used to do, ‘are we on the\nway from or to the first principles?’ There is a difference, as there is in\na race-course between the course from the judges to the turning-point\nand the way back. For, while we must begin with what is known, things\nare objects of knowledge in two senses—some to us, some without quali-\nfication. Presumably, then, we must begin with things known to us.\nHence any one who is to listen intelligently to lectures about what is\nnoble and just, and generally, about the subjects of political science\nmust have been brought up in good habits. For the fact is the starting-\npoint, and if this is sufficiently plain to him, he will not at the start need\nthe reason as well; and the man who has been well brought up has or can\neasily get starting-points. And as for him who neither has nor can get\nthem, let him hear the words of Hesiod:\nFar best is he who knows all things himself;\nGood, he that hearkens when men counsel right;\nBut he who neither knows, nor lays to heart\nAnother’s wisdom, is a useless wight.",

    "text": "Let us, however, resume our discussion from the point at which we\ndigressed. To judge from the lives that men lead, most men, and men of\nthe most vulgar type, seem (not without some ground) to identify the\ngood, or happiness, with pleasure; which is the reason why they love the\nlife of enjoyment. For there are, we may say, three prominent types of\nlife—that just mentioned, the political, and thirdly the contemplative\nlife. Now the mass of mankind are evidently quite slavish in their tastes,\npreferring a life suitable to beasts, but they get some ground for their\nview from the fact that many of those in high places share the tastes of\nSardanapallus. A consideration of the prominent types of life shows\nthat people of superior refinement and of active disposition identify hap-\npiness with honour; for this is, roughly speaking, the end of the political\nlife. But it seems too superficial to be what we are looking for, since it is\nthought to depend on those who bestow honour rather than on him who\nreceives it, but the good we divine to be something proper to a man and\nnot easily taken from him. Further, men seem to pursue honour in order\nthat they may be assured of their goodness; at least it is by men of\npractical wisdom that they seek to be honoured, and among those who\nknow them, and on the ground of their virtue; clearly, then, according to\nthem, at any rate, virtue is better. And perhaps one might even suppose\nthis to be, rather than honour, the end of the political life. But even this\nappears somewhat incomplete; for possession of virtue seems actually\ncompatible with being asleep, or with lifelong inactivity, and, further,\nwith the greatest sufferings and misfortunes; but a man who was living\nso no one would call happy, unless he were maintaining a thesis at all\ncosts. But enough of this; for the subject has been sufficiently treated\neven in the current discussions. Third comes the contemplative life, which\nwe shall consider later.\nThe life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion, and\nwealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful\nand for the sake of something else. And so one might rather take the\naforenamed objects to be ends; for they are loved for themselves. But it\nis evident that not even these are ends; yet many arguments have been\nthrown away in support of them. Let us leave this subject, then.",

    "text": "We had perhaps better consider the universal good and discuss thor-\noughly what is meant by it, although such an inquiry is made an uphill\none by the fact that the Forms have been introduced by friends of our\nown. Yet it would perhaps be thought to be better, indeed to be our duty,\nfor the sake of maintaining the truth even to destroy what touches us\nclosely, especially as we are philosophers or lovers of wisdom; for, while\nboth are dear, piety requires us to honour truth above our friends.\nThe men who introduced this doctrine did not posit Ideas of classes\nwithin which they recognized priority and posteriority (which is the rea-\nson why they did not maintain the existence of an Idea embracing all\nnumbers); but the term ‘good’ is used both in the category of substance\nand in that of quality and in that of relation, and that which is per se,\ni.e., substance, is prior in nature to the relative (for the latter is like an\noff shoot and accident of being); so that there could not be a common\nIdea set over all these goods. Further, since ‘good’ has as many senses\nas ‘being’ (for it is predicated both in the category of substance, as of\nGod and of reason, and in quality, i.e., of the virtues, and in quantity,\ni.e., of that which is moderate, and in relation, i.e., of the useful, and in\ntime, i.e., of the right opportunity, and in place, i.e., of the right locality\nand the like), clearly it cannot be something universally present in all\ncases and single; for then it could not have been predicated in all the\ncategories but in one only. Further, since of the things answering to one\nIdea there is one science, there would have been one science of all the\ngoods; but as it is there are many sciences even of the things that fall\nunder one category, e.g., of opportunity, for opportunity in war is stud-\nied by strategics and in disease by medicine, and the moderate in food is\nstudied by medicine and in exercise by the science of gymnastics. And\none might ask the question, what in the world they mean by ‘a thing\nitself,’ is (as is the case) in ‘man himself’ and in a particular man the\naccount of man is one and the same. For in so far as they are man, they\nwill in no respect differ; and if this is so, neither will ‘good itself’ and\nparticular goods, in so far as they are good. But again it will not be good\nany the more for being eternal, since that which lasts long is no whiter\nthan that which perishes in a day. The Pythagoreans seem to give a more\nplausible account of the good, when they place the one in the column of\ngoods; and it is they that Speusippus seems to have followed.\nBut let us discuss these matters elsewhere; an objection to what we\nhave said, however, may be discerned in the fact that the Platonists have\nnot been speaking about all goods, and that the goods that are pursued\nand loved for themselves are called good by reference to a single Form,\nwhile those which tend to produce or to preserve these somehow or to\nprevent their contraries are called so by reference to these, and in a\nsecondary sense. Clearly, then, goods must be spoken of in two ways,\nand some must be good in themselves, the others by reason of these. Let\nus separate, then, things good in themselves from things useful, and\nconsider whether the former are called good by reference to a single\nIdea. What sort of goods would one call good in themselves? Is it those\nthat are pursued even when isolated from others, such as intelligence,\nsight, and certain pleasures and honours? Certainly, if we pursue these\nalso for the sake of something else, yet one would place them among\nthings good in themselves. Or is nothing other than the Idea of good\ngood in itself? In that case the Form will be empty. But if the things we\nhave named are also things good in themselves, the account of the good\nwill have to appear as something identical in them all, as that of white-\nness is identical in snow and in white lead. But of honour, wisdom, and\npleasure, just in respect of their goodness, the accounts are distinct and\ndiverse. The good, therefore, is not some common element answering to\none Idea.\nBut what then do we mean by the good? It is surely not like the\nthings that only chance to have the same name. Are goods one, then, by\nbeing derived from one good or by all contributing to one good, or are\nthey rather one by analogy? Certainly as sight is in the body, so is rea-\nson in the soul, and so on in other cases. But perhaps these subjects had\nbetter be dismissed for the present; for perfect precision about them\nwould be more appropriate to another branch of philosophy. And simi-\nlarly with regard to the Idea; even if there is some one good which is\nuniversally predicable of goods or is capable of separate and indepen-\ndent existence, clearly it could not be achieved or attained by man; but\nwe are now seeking something attainable. Perhaps, however, some one\nmight think it worth while to recognize this with a view to the goods that\nare attainable and achievable; for having this as a sort of pattern we\nshall know better the goods that are good for us, and if we know them\nshall attain them. This argument has some plausibility, but seems to\nclash with the procedure of the sciences; for all of these, though they\naim at some good and seek to supply the deficiency of it, leave on one\nside the knowledge of the good. Yet that all the exponents of the arts\nshould be ignorant of, and should not even seek, so great an aid is not\nprobable. It is hard, too, to see how a weaver or a carpenter will be\nbenefited in regard to his own craft by knowing this ‘good itself,’ or\nhow the man who has viewed the Idea itself will be a better doctor or\ngeneral thereby. For a doctor seems not even to study health in this way,\nbut the health of man, or perhaps rather the health of a particular man;\nit is individuals that he is healing. But enough of these topics.",

    "text": "Let us again return to the good we are seeking, and ask what it can be.\nIt seems different in different actions and arts; it is different in medicine,\nin strategy, and in the other arts likewise. What then is the good of each?\nSurely that for whose sake everything else is done. In medicine this is\nhealth, in strategy victory, in architecture a house, in any other sphere\nsomething else, and in every action and pursuit the end; for it is for the\nsake of this that all men do whatever else they do. Therefore, if there is\nan end for all that we do, this will be the good achievable by action, and\nif there are more than one, these will be the goods achievable by action.\nSo the argument has by a different course reached the same point;\nbut we must try to state this even more clearly. Since there are evidently\nmore than one end, and we choose some of these (e.g., wealth, flutes,\nand in general instruments) for the sake of something else, clearly not\nall ends are final ends; but the chief good is evidently something final.\nTherefore, if there is only one final end, this will be what we are seek-\ning, and if there are more than one, the most final of these will be what\nwe are seeking. Now we call that which is in itself worthy of pursuit\nmore final than that which is worthy of pursuit for the sake of some-\nthing else, and that which is never desirable for the sake of something\nelse more final than the things that are desirable both in themselves and\nfor the sake of that other thing, and therefore we call final without quali-\nfication that which is always desirable in itself and never for the sake of\nsomething else.\nNow such a thing happiness, above all else, is held to be; for this we\nchoose always for self and never for the sake of something else, but\nhonour, pleasure, reason, and every virtue we choose indeed for them-\nselves (for if nothing resulted from them we should still choose each of\nthem), but we choose them also for the sake of happiness, judging that\nby means of them we shall be happy. Happiness, on the other hand, no\none chooses for the sake of these, nor, in general, for anything other\nthan itself.\nFrom the point of view of self-sufficiency the same result seems to\nfollow; for the final good is thought to be self-sufficient. Now by self-\nsufficient we do not mean that which is sufficient for a man by himself,\nfor one who lives a solitary life, but also for parents, children, wife, and\nin general for his friends and fellow citizens, since man is born for citi-\nzenship. But some limit must be set to this; for if we extend our require-\nment to ancestors and descendants and friends’ friends we are in for an\ninfinite series. Let us examine this question, however, on another occa-\nsion; the self-sufficient we now define as that which when isolated makes\nlife desirable and lacking in nothing; and such we think happiness to be;\nand further we think it most desirable of all things, without being counted\nas one good thing among others—if it were so counted it would clearly\nbe made more desirable by the addition of even the least of goods; for\nthat which is added becomes an excess of goods, and of goods the greater\nis always more desirable. Happiness, then, is something final and self-\nsufficient, and is the end of action.\nPresumably, however, to say that happiness is the chief good seems\na platitude, and a clearer account of what it is still desired. This might\nperhaps be given, if we could first ascertain the function of man. For\njust as for a flute-player, a sculptor, or an artist, and, in general, for all\nthings that have a function or activity, the good and the ‘well’ is thought\nto reside in the function, so would it seem to be for man, if he has a\nfunction. Have the carpenter, then, and the tanner certain functions or\nactivities, and has man none? Is he born without a function? Or as eye,\nhand, foot, and in general each of the parts evidently has a function,\nmay one lay it down that man similarly has a function apart from all\nthese? What then can this be? Life seems to be common even to plants,\nbut we are seeking what is peculiar to man. Let us exclude, therefore,\nthe life of nutrition and growth. Next there would be a life of perception,\nbut it also seems to be common even to the horse, the ox, and every\nanimal. There remains, then, an active life of the element that has a\nrational principle; of this, one part has such a principle in the sense of\nbeing obedient to one, the other in the sense of possessing one and exer-\ncising thought. And, as ‘life of the rational element’ also has two mean-\nings, we must state that life in the sense of activity is what we mean; for\nthis seems to be the more proper sense of the term. Now if the function\nof man is an activity of soul which follows or implies a rational prin-\nciple, and if we say ‘so-and-so-and ‘a good so-and-so’ have a function\nwhich is the same in kind, e.g., a lyre, and a good lyre-player, and so\nwithout qualification in all cases, eminence in respect of goodness being\nidded to the name of the function (for the function of a lyre-player is to\nplay the lyre, and that of a good lyre-player is to do so well): if this is the\ncase, and we state the function of man to be a certain kind of life, and\nthis to be an activity or actions of the soul implying a rational principle,\nand the function of a good man to be the good and noble performance of\nthese, and if any action is well performed when it is performed in accor-\ndance with the appropriate excellence: if this is the case, human good\nturns out to be activity of soul in accordance with virtue, and if there are\nmore than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete.\nBut we must add ‘in a complete life.’ For one swallow does not\nmake a summer, nor does one day; and so too one day, or a short time,\ndoes not make a man blessed and happy.\nLet this serve as an outline of the good; for we must presumably\nfirst sketch it roughly, and then later fill in the details. But it would seem\nthat any one is capable of carrying on and articulating what has once\nbeen well outlined, and that time is a good discoverer or partner in such\na work; to which facts the advances of the arts are due; for any one can\nadd what is lacking. And we must also remember what has been said\nbefore, and not look for precision in all things alike, but in each class of\nthings such precision as accords with the subject-matter, and so much\nas is appropriate to the inquiry. For a carpenter and a geometer investi-\ngate the right angle in different ways; the former does so in so far as the\nright angle is useful for his work, while the latter inquires what it is or\nwhat sort of thing it is; for he is a spectator of the truth. We must act in\nthe same way, then, in all other matters as well, that our main task may\nnot be subordinated to minor questions. Nor must we demand the cause\nin all matters alike; it is enough in some cases that the fact be well\nestablished, as in the case of the first principles; the fact is the primary\nthing or first principle. Now of first principles we see some by induc-\ntion, some by perception, some by a certain habituation, and others too\nin other ways. But each set of principles we must try to investigate in the\nnatural way, and we must take pains to state them definitely, since they\nhave a great influence on what follows. For the beginning is thought to\nbe more than half of the whole, and many of the questions we ask are\ncleared up by it.",

    "text": "We must consider it, however, in the light not only of our conclusion and\nour premisses, but also of what is commonly said about it; for with a\ntrue view all the data harmonize, but with a false one the facts soon\nclash. Now goods have been divided into three classes, and some are\ndescribed as external, others as relating to soul or to body; we call those\nthat relate to soul most properly and truly goods, and psychical actions\nand activities we class as relating to soul. Therefore our account must\nbe sound, at least according to this view, which is an old one and agreed\non by philosophers. It is correct also in that we identify the end with\ncertain actions and activities; for thus it falls among goods of the soul\nand not among external goods. Another belief which harmonizes with\nour account is that the happy man lives well and does well; for we have\npractically defined happiness as a sort of good life and good action. The\ncharacteristics that are looked for in happiness seem also, all of them, to\nbelong to what we have defined happiness as being. For some identify\nhappiness with virtue, some with practical wisdom, others with a kind\nof philosophic wisdom, others with these, or one of these, accompanied\nby pleasure or not without pleasure; while others include also external\nprosperity. Now some of these views have been held by many men and\nmen of old, others by a few eminent persons; and it is not probable that\neither of these should be entirely mistaken, but rather that they should\nbe right in at least some one respect or even in most respects.\nWith those who identify happiness with virtue or some one virtue\nour account is in harmony; for to virtue belongs virtuous activity. But it\nmakes, perhaps, no small difference whether we place the chief good in\npossession or in use, in state of mind or in activity. For the state of mind\nmay exist without producing any good result, as in a man who is asleep\nor in some other way quite inactive, but the activity cannot; for one who\nhas the activity will of necessity be acting, and acting well. And as in the\nOlympic Games it is not the most beautiful and the strongest that are\ncrowned but those who compete (for it is some of these that are victori-\nous), so those who act win, and rightly win, the noble and good things in\nlife.\nTheir life is also in itself pleasant. For pleasure is a state of soul,\nand to each man that which he is said to be a lover of is pleasant; e.g.,\nnot only is a horse pleasant to the lover of horses, and a spectacle to the\nlover of sights, but also in the same way just acts are pleasant to the\nlover of justice and in general virtuous acts to the lover of virtue. Now\nfor most men their pleasures are in conflict with one another because\nthese are not by nature pleasant, but the lovers of what is noble find\npleasant the things that are by nature pleasant; and virtuous actions are\nsuch, so that these are pleasant for such men as well as in their own\nnature. Their life, therefore, has no further need of pleasure as a sort of\nadventitious charm, but has its pleasure in itself. For, besides what we\nhave said, the man who does not rejoice in noble actions is not even\ngood; since no one would call a man just who did not enjoy acting justly,\nnor any man liberal who did not enjoy liberal actions; and similarly in\nall other cases. If this is so, virtuous actions must be in themselves\npleasant. But they are also good and noble, and have each of these at-\ntributes in the highest degree, since the good man judges well about\nthese attributes; his judgement is such as we have described. Happiness\nthen is the best, noblest, and most pleasant thing in the world, and these\nattributes are not severed as in the inscription at Delos—\nMost noble is that which is justest, and best is health;\nBut pleasantest is it to win what we love.\nFor all these properties belong to the best activities; and these, or\none—the best—of these, we identify with happiness.\nYet evidently, as we said, it needs the external goods as well; for it is\nimpossible, or not easy, to do noble acts without the proper equipment.\nIn many actions we use friends and riches and political power as instru-\nments; and there are some things the lack of which takes the lustre from\nhappiness, as good birth, goodly children, beauty; for the man who is\nvery ugly in appearance or ill-born or solitary and childless is not very\nlikely to be happy, and perhaps a man would be still less likely if he had\nthoroughly bad children or friends or had lost good children or friends\nby death. As we said, then, happiness seems to need this sort of prosper-\nity in addition; for which reason some identify happiness with good\nfortune, though others identify it with virtue.",

    "text": "For this reason also the question is asked, whether happiness is to be\nacquired by learning or by habituation or some other sort of training, or\ncomes in virtue of some divine providence or again by chance. Now if\nthere is any gift of the gods to men, it is reasonable that happiness should\nbe god-given, and most surely god-given of all human things inasmuch\nas it is the best. But this question would perhaps be more appropriate to\nanother inquiry; happiness seems, however, even if it is not god-sent but\ncomes as a result of virtue and some process of learning or training, to\nbe among the most godlike things; for that which is the prize and end of\nvirtue seems to be the best thing in the world, and something godlike and\nblessed.\nIt will also on this view be very generally shared; for all who are not\nmaimed as regards their potentiality for virtue may win it by a certain\nkind of study and care. But if it is better to be happy thus than by\nchance, it is reasonable that the facts should be so, since everything that\ndepends on the action of nature is by nature as good as it can be, and\nsimilarly everything that depends on art or any rational cause, and espe-\ncially if it depends on the best of all causes. To entrust to chance what is\ngreatest and most noble would be a very defective arrangement.\nThe answer to the question we are asking is plain also from the\ndefinition of happiness; for it has been said to be a virtuous activity of\nsoul, of a certain kind. Of the remaining goods, some must necessarily\npre-exist as conditions of happiness, and others are naturally co-opera-\ntive and useful as instruments. And this will be found to agree with what\nwe said at the outset; for we stated the end of political science to be the\nbest end, and political science spends most of its pains on making the\ncitizens to be of a certain character, viz. good and capable of noble acts.\nIt is natural, then, that we call neither ox nor horse nor any other of\nthe animals happy; for none of them is capable of sharing in such activ-\nity. For this reason also a boy is not happy; for he is not yet capable of\nsuch acts, owing to his age; and boys who are called happy are being\ncongratulated by reason of the hopes we have for them. For there is\nrequired, as we said, not only complete virtue but also a complete life,\nsince many changes occur in life, and all manner of chances, and the\nmost prosperous may fall into great misfortunes in old age, as is told of\nPriam in the Trojan Cycle; and one who has experienced such chances\nand has ended wretchedly no one calls happy.",

    "text": "Must no one at all, then, be called happy while he lives; must we, as\nSolon says, see the end? Even if we are to lay down this doctrine, is it\nalso the case that a man is happy when he is dead? Or is not this quite\nabsurd, especially for us who say that happiness is an activity? But if\nwe do not call the dead man happy, and if Solon does not mean this, but\nthat one can then safely call a man blessed as being at last beyond evils\nand misfortunes, this also affords matter for discussion; for both evil\nand good are thought to exist for a dead man, as much as for one who is\nalive but not aware of them; e.g., honours and dishonours and the good\nor bad fortunes of children and in general of descendants. And this also\npresents a problem; for though a man has lived happily up to old age\nand has had a death worthy of his life, many reverses may befall his\ndescendants—some of them may be good and attain the life they de-\nserve, while with others the opposite may be the case; and clearly too\nthe degrees of relationship between them and their ancestors may vary\nindefinitely. It would be odd, then, if the dead man were to share in these\nchanges and become at one time happy, at another wretched; while it\nwould also be odd if the fortunes of the descendants did not for some\ntime have some effect on the happiness of their ancestors.\nBut we must return to our first difficulty; for perhaps by a consider-\nation of it our present problem might be solved. Now if we must see the\nend and only then call a man happy, not as being happy but as having\nbeen so before, surely this is a paradox, that when he is happy the at-\ntribute that belongs to him is not to be truly predicated of him because\nwe do not wish to call living men happy, on account of the changes that\nmay befall them, and because we have assumed happiness to be some-\nthing permanent and by no means easily changed, while a single man\nmay suffer many turns of fortune’s wheel. For clearly if we were to keep\npace with his fortunes, we should often call the same man happy and\nagain wretched, making the happy man out to be chameleon and inse-\ncurely based. Or is this keeping pace with his fortunes quite wrong?\nSuccess or failure in life does not depend on these, but human life, as we\nsaid, needs these as mere additions, while virtuous activities or their\nopposites are what constitute happiness or the reverse.\nThe question we have now discussed confirms our definition. For\nno function of man has so much permanence as virtuous activities (these\nare thought to be more durable even than knowledge of the sciences),\nand of these themselves the most valuable are more durable because\nthose who are happy spend their life most readily and most continuously\nin these; for this seems to be the reason why we do not forget them. The\nattribute in question, then, will belong to the happy man, and he will be\nhappy throughout his life; for always, or by preference to everything\nelse, he will be engaged in virtuous action and contemplation, and he\nwill bear the chances of life most nobly and altogether decorously, if he\nis ‘truly good’ and ‘foursquare beyond reproach’.\nNow many events happen by chance, and events differing in impor-\ntance; small pieces of good fortune or of its opposite clearly do not\nweigh down the scales of life one way or the other, but a multitude of\ngreat events if they turn out well will make life happier (for not only are\nthey themselves such as to add beauty to life, but the way a man deals\nwith them may be noble and good), while if they turn out ill they crush\nand maim happiness; for they both bring pain with them and hinder\nmany activities. Yet even in these nobility shines through, when a man\nbears with resignation many great misfortunes, not through insensibil-\nity to pain but through nobility and greatness of soul.\nIf activities are, as we said, what gives life its character, no happy\nman can become miserable; for he will never do the acts that are hateful\nand mean. For the man who is truly good and wise, we think, bears all\nthe chances life becomingly and always makes the best of circumstances,\nas a good general makes the best military use of the army at his com-\nmand and a good shoemaker makes the best shoes out of the hides that\nare given him; and so with all other craftsmen. And if this is the case,\nthe happy man can never become miserable; though he will not reach\nblessedness, if he meet with fortunes like those of Priam.\nNor, again, is he many-coloured and changeable; for neither will he\nbe moved from his happy state easily or by any ordinary misadventures,\nbut only by many great ones, nor, if he has had many great misadven-\ntures, will he recover his happiness in a short time, but if at all, only in\na long and complete one in which he has attained many splendid suc-\ncesses.\nWhen then should we not say that he is happy who is active in\naccordance with complete virtue and is sufficiently equipped with exter-\nnal goods, not for some chance period but throughout a complete life?\nOr must we add ‘and who is destined to live thus and die as befits his\nlife’? Certainly the future is obscure to us, while happiness, we claim, is\nan end and something in every way final. If so, we shall call happy those\namong living men in whom these conditions are, and are to be, ful-\nfilled—but happy men. So much for these questions.",

    "text": "That the fortunes of descendants and of all a man’s friends should not\naffect his happiness at all seems a very unfriendly doctrine, and one\nopposed to the opinions men hold; but since the events that happen are\nnumerous and admit of all sorts of difference, and some come more near\nto us and others less so, it seems a long—nay, an infinite—task to dis-\ncuss each in detail; a general outline will perhaps suffice. If, then, as\nsome of a man’s own misadventures have a certain weight and influence\non life while others are, as it were, lighter, so too there are differences\namong the misadventures of our friends taken as a whole, and it makes\na difference whether the various suffering befall the living or the dead\n(much more even than whether lawless and terrible deeds are presup-\nposed in a tragedy or done on the stage), this difference also must be\ntaken into account; or rather, perhaps, the fact that doubt is felt whether\nthe dead share in any good or evil. For it seems, from these consider-\nations, that even if anything whether good or evil penetrates to them, it\nmust be something weak and negligible, either in itself or for them, or if\nnot, at least it must be such in degree and kind as not to make happy\nthose who are not happy nor to take away their blessedness from those\nwho are. The good or bad fortunes of friends, then, seem to have some\neffects on the dead, but effects of such a kind and degree as neither to\nmake the happy unhappy nor to produce any other change of the kind.",

    "text": "These questions having been definitely answered, let us consider whether\nhappiness is among the things that are praised or rather among the things\nthat are prized; for clearly it is not to be placed among potentialities.\nEverything that is praised seems to be praised because it is of a certain\nkind and is related somehow to something else; for we praise the just or\nbrave man and in general both the good man and virtue itself because of\nthe actions and functions involved, and we praise the strong man, the\ngood runner, and so on, because he is of a certain kind and is related in\na certain way to something good and important. This is clear also from\nthe praises of the gods; for it seems absurd that the gods should be\nreferred to our standard, but this is done because praise involves a ref-\nerence, to something else. But if if praise is for things such as we have\ndescribed, clearly what applies to the best things is not praise, but some-\nthing greater and better, as is indeed obvious; for what we do to the gods\nand the most godlike of men is to call them blessed and happy. And so\ntoo with good things; no one praises happiness as he does justice, but\nrather calls it blessed, as being something more divine and better.\nEudoxus also seems to have been right in his method of advocating\nthe supremacy of pleasure; he thought that the fact that, though a good,\nit is not praised indicated it to be better than the things that are praised,\nand that this is what God and the good are; for by reference to these all\nother things are judged. Praise is appropriate to virtue, for as a result of\nvirtue men tend to do noble deeds, but encomia are bestowed on acts,\nwhether of the body or of the soul. But perhaps nicety in these matters is\nmore proper to those who have made a study of encomia; to us it is clear\nfrom what has been said that happiness is among the things that are\nprized and perfect. It seems to be so also from the fact that it is a first\nprinciple; for it is for the sake of this that we all do all that we do, and\nthe first principle and cause of goods is, we claim, something prized and\ndivine.",

    "text": "Since happiness is an activity of soul in accordance with perfect virtue,\nwe must consider the nature of virtue; for perhaps we shall thus see\nbetter the nature of happiness. The true student of politics, too, is thought\nto have studied virtue above all things; for he wishes to make his fellow\ncitizens good and obedient to the laws. As an example of this we have\nthe lawgivers of the Cretans and the Spartans, and any others of the\nkind that there may have been. And if this inquiry belongs to political\nscience, clearly the pursuit of it will be in accordance with our original\nplan. But clearly the virtue we must study is human virtue; for the good\nwe were seeking was human good and the happiness human happiness.\nBy human virtue we mean not that of the body but that of the soul; and\nhappiness also we call an activity of soul. But if this is so, clearly the\nstudent of politics must know somehow the facts about soul, as the man\nwho is to heal the eyes or the body as a whole must know about the eyes\nor the body; and all the more since politics is more prized and better\nthan medicine; but even among doctors the best educated spend much\nlabour on acquiring knowledge of the body. The student of politics,\nthen, must study the soul, and must study it with these objects in view,\nand do so just to the extent which is sufficient for the questions we are\ndiscussing; for further precision is perhaps something more laborious\nthan our purposes require.\nSome things are said about it, adequately enough, even in the dis-\ncussions outside our school, and we must use these; e.g., that one ele-\nment in the soul is irrational and one has a rational principle. Whether\nthese are separated as the parts of the body or of anything divisible are,\nor are distinct by definition but by nature inseparable, like convex and\nconcave in the circumference of a circle, does not affect the present\nquestion.\nOf the irrational element one division seems to be widely distrib-\nuted, and vegetative in its nature, I mean that which causes nutrition and\ngrowth; for it is this kind of power of the soul that one must assign to all\nnurslings and to embryos, and this same power to fullgrown creatures;\nthis is more reasonable than to assign some different power to them.\nNow the excellence of this seems to be common to all species and not\nspecifically human; for this part or faculty seems to function most in\nsleep, while goodness and badness are least manifest in sleep (whence\ncomes the saying that the happy are not better off than the wretched for\nhalf their lives; and this happens naturally enough, since sleep is an\ninactivity of the soul in that respect in which it is called good or bad),\nunless perhaps to a small extent some of the movements actually pen-\netrate to the soul, and in this respect the dreams of good men are better\nthan those of ordinary people. Enough of this subject, however; let us\nleave the nutritive faculty alone, since it has by its nature no share in\nhuman excellence.\nThere seems to be also another irrational element in the soul-one\nwhich in a sense, however, shares in a rational principle. For we praise\nthe rational principle of the continent man and of the incontinent, and\nthe part of their soul that has such a principle, since it urges them aright\nand towards the best objects; but there is found in them also another\nelement naturally opposed to the rational principle, which fights against\nand resists that principle. For exactly as paralysed limbs when we in-\ntend to move them to the right turn on the contrary to the left, so is it\nwith the soul; the impulses of incontinent people move in contrary direc-\ntions. But while in the body we see that which moves astray, in the soul\nwe do not. No doubt, however, we must none the less suppose that in the\nsoul too there is something contrary to the rational principle, resisting\nand opposing it. In what sense it is distinct from the other elements does\nnot concern us. Now even this seems to have a share in a rational prin-\nciple, as we said; at any rate in the continent man it obeys the rational\nprinciple and presumably in the temperate and brave man it is still more\nobedient; for in him it speaks, on all matters, with the same voice as the\nrational principle.\nTherefore the irrational element also appears to be two-fold. For\nthe vegetative element in no way shares in a rational principle, but the\nappetitive and in general the desiring element in a sense shares in it, in\nso far as it listens to and obeys it; this is the sense in which we speak of\n‘taking account’ of one’s father or one’s friends, not that in which we\nspeak of ‘accounting for a mathematical property. That the irrational\nelement is in some sense persuaded by a rational principle is indicated\nalso by the giving of advice and by all reproof and exhortation. And if\nthis element also must be said to have a rational principle, that which\nhas a rational principle (as well as that which has not) will be twofold,\none subdivision having it in the strict sense and in itself, and the other\nhaving a tendency to obey as one does one’s father.\nVirtue too is distinguished into kinds in accordance with this differ-\nence; for we say that some of the virtues are intellectual and others\nmoral, philosophic wisdom and understanding and practical wisdom\nbeing intellectual, liberality and temperance moral. For in speaking about\na man’s character we do not say that he is wise or has understanding but\nthat he is good-tempered or temperate; yet we praise the wise man also\nwith respect to his state of mind; and of states of mind we call those\nwhich merit praise virtues.",

    "text": "Virtue, then, being of two kinds, intellectual and moral, intellectual vir-\ntue in the main owes both its birth and its growth to teaching (for which\nreason it requires experience and time), while moral virtue comes about\nas a result of habit, whence also its name (ethike) is one that is formed\nby a slight variation from the word ethos (habit). From this it is also\nplain that none of the moral virtues arises in us by nature; for nothing\nthat exists by nature can form a habit contrary to its nature. For in-\nstance the stone which by nature moves downwards cannot be habitu-\nated to move upwards, not even if one tries to train it by throwing it up\nten thousand times; nor can fire be habituated to move downwards, nor\ncan anything else that by nature behaves in one way be trained to be-\nhave in another. Neither by nature, then, nor contrary to nature do the\nvirtues arise in us; rather we are adapted by nature to receive them, and\nare made perfect by habit.\nAgain, of all the things that come to us by nature we first acquire\nthe potentiality and later exhibit the activity (this is plain in the case of\nthe senses; for it was not by often seeing or often hearing that we got\nthese senses, but on the contrary we had them before we used them, and\ndid not come to have them by using them); but the virtues we get by first\nexercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well. For the\nthings we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them,\ne.g., men become builders by building and lyreplayers by playing the\nlyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing tem-\nperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.\nThis is confirmed by what happens in states; for legislators make\nthe citizens good by forming habits in them, and this is the wish of every\nlegislator, and those who do not effect it miss their mark, and it is in this\nthat a good constitution differs from a bad one.\nAgain, it is from the same causes and by the same means that every\nvirtue is both produced and destroyed, and similarly every art; for it is\nfrom playing the lyre that both good and bad lyre-players are produced.\nAnd the corresponding statement is true of builders and of all the rest;\nmen will be good or bad builders as a result of building well or badly.\nFor if this were not so, there would have been no need of a teacher, but\nall men would have been born good or bad at their craft. This, then, is\nthe case with the virtues also; by doing the acts that we do in our trans-\nactions with other men we become just or unjust, and by doing the acts\nthat we do in the presence of danger, and being habituated to feel fear or\nconfidence, we become brave or cowardly. The same is true of appetites\nand feelings of anger; some men become temperate and good-tempered,\nothers self-indulgent and irascible, by behaving in one way or the other\nin the appropriate circumstances. Thus, in one word, states of character\narise out of like activities. This is why the activities we exhibit must be\nof a certain kind; it is because the states of character correspond to the\ndifferences between these. It makes no small difference, then, whether\nwe form habits of one kind or of another from our very youth; it makes\na very great difference, or rather all the difference.",

    "text": "Since, then, the present inquiry does not aim at theoretical knowledge\nlike the others (for we are inquiring not in order to know what virtue is,\nbut in order to become good, since otherwise our inquiry would have\nbeen of no use), we must examine the nature of actions, namely how we\nought to do them; for these determine also the nature of the states of\ncharacter that are produced, as we have said. Now, that we must act\naccording to the right rule is a common principle and must be assumed-\nit will be discussed later, i.e., both what the right rule is, and how it is\nrelated to the other virtues. But this must be agreed upon beforehand,\nthat the whole account of matters of conduct must be given in outline\nand not precisely, as we said at the very beginning that the accounts we\ndemand must be in accordance with the subject-matter; matters con-\ncerned with conduct and questions of what is good for us have no fixity,\nany more than matters of health. The general account being of this na-\nture, the account of particular cases is yet more lacking in exactness; for\nthey do not fall under any art or precept but the agents themselves must\nin each case consider what is appropriate to the occasion, as happens\nalso in the art of medicine or of navigation.\nBut though our present account is of this nature we must give what\nhelp we can. First, then, let us consider this, that it is the nature of such\nthings to be destroyed by defect and excess, as we see in the case of\nstrength and of health (for to gain light on things imperceptible we must\nuse the evidence of sensible things); both excessive and defective exer-\ncise destroys the strength, and similarly drink or food which is above or\nbelow a certain amount destroys the health, while that which is propor-\ntionate both produces and increases and preserves it. So too is it, then,\nin the case of temperance and courage and the other virtues. For the\nman who flies from and fears everything and does not stand his ground\nagainst anything becomes a coward, and the man who fears nothing at\nall but goes to meet every danger becomes rash; and similarly the man\nwho indulges in every pleasure and abstains from none becomes self-\nindulgent, while the man who shuns every pleasure, as boors do, be-\ncomes in a way insensible; temperance and courage, then, are destroyed\nby excess and defect, and preserved by the mean.\nBut not only are the sources and causes of their origination and\ngrowth the same as those of their destruction, but also the sphere of\ntheir actualization will be the same; for this is also true of the things\nwhich are more evident to sense, e.g., of strength; it is produced by\ntaking much food and undergoing much exertion, and it is the strong\nman that will be most able to do these things. So too is it with the vir-\ntues; by abstaining from pleasures we become temperate, and it is when\nwe have become so that we are most able to abstain from them; and\nsimilarly too in the case of courage; for by being habituated to despise\nthings that are terrible and to stand our ground against them we become\nbrave, and it is when we have become so that we shall be most able to\nstand our ground against them.",

    "text": "We must take as a sign of states of character the pleasure or pain that\nensues on acts; for the man who abstains from bodily pleasures and\ndelights in this very fact is temperate, while the man who is annoyed at\nit is self-indulgent, and he who stands his ground against things that are\nterrible and delights in this or at least is not pained is brave, while the\nman who is pained is a coward. For moral excellence is concerned with\npleasures and pains; it is on account of the pleasure that we do bad\nthings, and on account of the pain that we abstain from noble ones.\nHence we ought to have been brought up in a particular way from our\nvery youth, as Plato says, so as both to delight in and to be pained by the\nthings that we ought; for this is the right education.\nAgain, if the virtues are concerned with actions and passions, and\nevery passion and every action is accompanied by pleasure and pain,\nfor this reason also virtue will be concerned with pleasures and pains.\nThis is indicated also by the fact that punishment is inflicted by these\nmeans; for it is a kind of cure, and it is the nature of cures to be effected\nby contraries.\nAgain, as we said but lately, every state of soul has a nature relative\nto and concerned with the kind of things by which it tends to be made\nworse or better; but it is by reason of pleasures and pains that men\nbecome bad, by pursuing and avoiding these—either the pleasures and\npains they ought not or when they ought not or as they ought not, or by\ngoing wrong in one of the other similar ways that may be distinguished.\nHence men even define the virtues as certain states of impassivity and\nrest; not well, however, because they speak absolutely, and do not say\n‘as one ought’ and ‘as one ought not’ and ‘when one ought or ought\nnot,’ and the other things that may be added. We assume, then, that this\nkind of excellence tends to do what is best with regard to pleasures and\npains, and vice does the contrary.\nThe following facts also may show us that virtue and vice are con-\ncerned with these same things. There being three objects of choice and\nthree of avoidance, the noble, the advantageous, the pleasant, and their\ncontraries, the base, the injurious, the painful, about all of these the\ngood man tends to go right and the bad man to go wrong, and especially\nabout pleasure; for this is common to the animals, and also it accompa-\nnies all objects of choice; for even the noble and the advantageous ap-\npear pleasant.\nAgain, it has grown up with us all from our infancy; this is why it is\ndifficult to rub off this passion, engrained as it is in our life. And we\nmeasure even our actions, some of us more and others less, by the rule\nof pleasure and pain. For this reason, then, our whole inquiry must be\nabout these; for to feel delight and pain rightly or wrongly has no small\neffect on our actions.\nAgain, it is harder to fight with pleasure than with anger, to use\nHeraclitus’ phrase,’ but both art and virtue are always concerned with\nwhat is harder; for even the good is better when it is harder. Therefore\nfor this reason also the whole concern both of virtue and of political\nscience is with pleasures and pains; for the man who uses these well will\nbe good, he who uses them badly bad.\nThat virtue, then, is concerned with pleasures and pains, and that\nby the acts from which it arises it is both increased and, if they are done\ndifferently, destroyed, and that the acts from which it arose are those in\nwhich it actualizes itself—let this be taken as said.",

    "text": "The question might be asked,; what we mean by saying that we must\nbecome just by doing just acts, and temperate by doing temperate acts;\nfor if men do just and temperate acts, they are already just and temper-\nate, exactly as, if they do what is in accordance with the laws of gram-\nmar and of music, they are grammarians and musicians.\nOr is this not true even of the arts? It is possible to do something\nthat is in accordance with the laws of grammar, either by chance or at\nthe suggestion of another. A man will be a grammarian, then, only when\nhe has both done something grammatical and done it grammatically;\nand this means doing it in accordance with the grammatical knowledge\nin himself.\nAgain, the case of the arts and that of the virtues are not similar; for\nthe products of the arts have their goodness in themselves, so that it is\nenough that they should have a certain character, but if the acts that are\nin accordance with the virtues have themselves a certain character it\ndoes not follow that they are done justly or temperately. The agent also\nmust be in a certain condition when he does them; in the first place he\nmust have knowledge, secondly he must choose the acts, and choose\nthem for their own sakes, and thirdly his action must proceed from a\nfirm and unchangeable character. These are not reckoned in as condi-\ntions of the possession of the arts, except the bare knowledge; but as a\ncondition of the possession of the virtues knowledge has little or no\nweight, while the other conditions count not for a little but for every-\nthing, i.e., the very conditions which result from often doing just and\ntemperate acts.\nActions, then, are called just and temperate when they are such as\nthe just or the temperate man would do; but it is not the man who does\nthese that is just and temperate, but the man who also does them as just\nand temperate men do them. It is well said, then, that it is by doing just\nacts that the just man is produced, and by doing temperate acts the\ntemperate man; without doing these no one would have even a prospect\nof becoming good.\nBut most people do not do these, but take refuge in theory and think\nthey are being philosophers and will become good in this way, behaving\nsomewhat like patients who listen attentively to their doctors, but do\nnone of the things they are ordered to do. As the latter will not be made\nwell in body by such a course of treatment, the former will not be made\nwell in soul by such a course of philosophy.",

    "text": "Next we must consider what virtue is. Since things that are found in the\nsoul are of three kinds—passions, faculties, states of character, virtue\nmust be one of these. By passions I mean appetite, anger, fear, confi-\ndence, envy, joy, friendly feeling, hatred, longing, emulation, pity, and\nin general the feelings that are accompanied by pleasure or pain; by\nfaculties the things in virtue of which we are said to be capable of feel-\ning these, e.g., of becoming angry or being pained or feeling pity; by\nstates of character the things in virtue of which we stand well or badly\nwith reference to the passions, e.g., with reference to anger we stand\nbadly if we feel it violently or too weakly, and well if we feel it moder-\nately; and similarly with reference to the other passions.\nNow neither the virtues nor the vices are passions, because we are\nnot called good or bad on the ground of our passions, but are so called\non the ground of our virtues and our vices, and because we are neither\npraised nor blamed for our passions (for the man who feels fear or anger\nis not praised, nor is the man who simply feels anger blamed, but the\nman who feels it in a certain way), but for our virtues and our vices we\nare praised or blamed.\nAgain, we feel anger and fear without choice, but the virtues are\nmodes of choice or involve choice. Further, in respect of the passions we\nare said to be moved, but in respect of the virtues and the vices we are\nsaid not to be moved but to be disposed in a particular way.\nFor these reasons also they are not faculties; for we are neither\ncalled good nor bad, nor praised nor blamed, for the simple capacity of\nfeeling the passions; again, we have the faculties by nature, but we are\nnot made good or bad by nature; we have spoken of this before. If, then,\nthe virtues are neither passions nor faculties, all that remains is that they\nshould be states of character.\nThus we have stated what virtue is in respect of its genus.",

    "text": "We must, however, not only describe virtue as a state of character, but\nalso say what sort of state it is. We may remark, then, that every virtue\nor excellence both brings into good condition the thing of which it is the\nexcellence and makes the work of that thing be done well; e.g., the ex-\ncellence of the eye makes both the eye and its work good; for it is by the\nexcellence of the eye that we see well. Similarly the excellence of the\nhorse makes a horse both good in itself and good at running and at\ncarrying its rider and at awaiting the attack of the enemy. Therefore, if\nthis is true in every case, the virtue of man also will be the state of\ncharacter which makes a man good and which makes him do his own\nwork well.\nHow this is to happen we have stated already, but it will be made\nplain also by the following consideration of the specific nature of virtue.\nIn everything that is continuous and divisible it is possible to take more,\nless, or an equal amount, and that either in terms of the thing itself or\nrelatively to us; and the equal is an intermediate between excess and\ndefect. By the intermediate in the object I mean that which is equidistant\nfrom each of the extremes, which is one and the same for all men; by the\nintermediate relatively to us that which is neither too much nor too little—\nand this is not one, nor the same for all. For instance, if ten is many and\ntwo is few, six is the intermediate, taken in terms of the object; for it\nexceeds and is exceeded by an equal amount; this is intermediate ac-\ncording to arithmetical proportion. But the intermediate relatively to us\nis not to be taken so; if ten pounds are too much for a particular person\nto eat and two too little, it does not follow that the trainer will order six\npounds; for this also is perhaps too much for the person who is to take\nit, or too little—too little for Milo, too much for the beginner in athletic\nexercises. The same is true of running and wrestling. Thus a master of\nany art avoids excess and defect, but seeks the intermediate and chooses\nthis—the intermediate not in the object but relatively to us.\nIf it is thus, then, that every art does its work well—by looking to\nthe intermediate and judgling its works by this standard (so that we\noften say of good works of art that it is not possible either to take away\nor to add anything, implying that excess and defect destroy the goodness\nof works of art, while the mean preserves it; and good artists, as we say,\nlook to this in their work), and if, further, virtue is more exact and better\nthan any art, as nature also is, then virtue must have the quality of\naiming at the intermediate. I mean moral virtue; for it is this that is\nconcerned with passions and actions, and in these there is excess, de-\nfect, and the intermediate. For instance, both fear and confidence and\nappetite and anger and pity and in general pleasure and pain may be felt\nboth too much and too little, and in both cases not well; but to feel them\nat the right times, with reference to the right objects, towards the right\npeople, with the right motive, and in the right way, is what is both inter-\nmediate and best, and this is characteristic of virtue. Similarly with\nregard to actions also there is excess, defect, and the intermediate. Now\nvirtue is concerned with passions and actions, in which excess is a form\nof failure, and so is defect, while the intermediate is praised and is a\nform of success; and being praised and being successful are both char-\nacteristics of virtue. Therefore virtue is a kind of mean, since, as we\nhave seen, it aims at what is intermediate.\nAgain, it is possible to fail in many ways (for evil belongs to the\nclass of the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to that\nof the limited), while to succeed is possible only in one way (for which\nreason also one is easy and the other difficult—to miss the mark easy, to\nhit it difficult); for these reasons also, then, excess and defect are char-\nacteristic of vice, and the mean of virtue;\nFor men are good in but one way, but bad in many.\nVirtue, then, is a state of character concerned with choice, lying in a\nmean, i.e., the mean relative to us, this being determined by a rational\nprinciple, and by that principle by which the man of practical wisdom\nwould determine it. Now it is a mean between two vices, that which\ndepends on excess and that which depends on defect; and again it is a\nmean because the vices respectively fall short of or exceed what is right\nin both passions and actions, while virtue both finds and chooses that\nwhich is intermediate. Hence in respect of its substance and the defini-\ntion which states its essence virtue is a mean, with regard to what is best\nand right an extreme.\nBut not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some\nhave names that already imply badness, e.g., spite, shamelessness, envy,\nand in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of these and\nsuchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad, and\nnot the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever to\nbe right with regard to them; one must always be wrong. Nor does good-\nness or badness with regard to such things depend on committing adul-\ntery with the right woman, at the right time, and in the right way, but\nsimply to do any of them is to go wrong. It would be equally absurd,\nthen, to expect that in unjust, cowardly, and voluptuous action there\nshould be a mean, an excess, and a deficiency; for at that rate there\nwould be a mean of excess and of deficiency, an excess of excess, and a\ndeficiency of deficiency. But as there is no excess and deficiency of\ntemperance and courage because what is intermediate is in a sense an\nextreme, so too of the actions we have mentioned there is no mean nor\nany excess and deficiency, but however they are done they are wrong;\nfor in general there is neither a mean of excess and deficiency, nor ex-\ncess and deficiency of a mean.",

    "text": "We must, however, not only make this general statement, but also apply\nit to the individual facts. For among statements about conduct those\nwhich are general apply more widely, but those which are particular are\nmore genuine, since conduct has to do with individual cases, and our\nstatements must harmonize with the facts in these cases. We may take\nthese cases from our table. With regard to feelings of fear and confi-\ndence courage is the mean; of the people who exceed, he who exceeds in\nfearlessness has no name (many of the states have no name), while the\nman who exceeds in confidence is rash, and he who exceeds in fear and\nfalls short in confidence is a coward. With regard to pleasures and pains—\nnot all of them, and not so much with regard to the pains—the mean is\ntemperance, the excess self-indulgence. Persons deficient with regard to\nthe pleasures are not often found; hence such persons also have received\nno name. But let us call them ‘insensible.’\nWith regard to giving and taking of money the mean is liberality, the\nexcess and the defect prodigality and meanness. In these actions people\nexceed and fall short in contrary ways; the prodigal exceeds in spending\nand falls short in taking, while the mean man exceeds in taking and falls\nshort in spending. (At present we are giving a mere outline or summary,\nand are satisfied with this; later these states will be more exactly deter-\nmined.) With regard to money there are also other dispositions—a mean,\nmagnificence (for the magnificent man differs from the liberal man; the\nformer deals with large sums, the latter with small ones), an excess,\ntastelessness and vulgarity, and a deficiency, niggardliness; these differ\nfrom the states opposed to liberality, and the mode of their difference\nwill be stated later. With regard to honour and dishonour the mean is\nproper pride, the excess is known as a sort of ‘empty vanity,’ and the\ndeficiency is undue humility; and as we said liberality was related to\nmagnificence, differing from it by dealing with small sums, so there is a\nstate similarly related to proper pride, being concerned with small honours\nwhile that is concerned with great. For it is possible to desire honour as\none ought, and more than one ought, and less, and the man who exceeds\nin his desires is called ambitious, the man who falls short unambitious,\nwhile the intermediate person has no name. The dispositions also are\nnameless, except that that of the ambitious man is called ambition. Hence\nthe people who are at the extremes lay claim to the middle place; and we\nourselves sometimes call the intermediate person ambitious and some-\ntimes unambitious, and sometimes praise the ambitious man and some-\ntimes the unambitious. The reason of our doing this will be stated in\nwhat follows; but now let us speak of the remaining states according to\nthe method which has been indicated.\nWith regard to anger also there is an excess, a deficiency, and a\nmean. Although they can scarcely be said to have names, yet since we\ncall the intermediate person good-tempered let us call the mean good\ntemper; of the persons at the extremes let the one who exceeds be called\nirascible, and his vice irascibility, and the man who falls short an\ninirascible sort of person, and the deficiency inirascibility.\nThere are also three other means, which have a certain likeness to\none another, but differ from one another: for they are all concerned with\nintercourse in words and actions, but differ in that one is concerned with\ntruth in this sphere, the other two with pleasantness; and of this one kind\nis exhibited in giving amusement, the other in all the circumstances of\nlife. We must therefore speak of these too, that we may the better see\nthat in all things the mean is praise-worthy, and the extremes neither\npraiseworthy nor right, but worthy of blame. Now most of these states\nalso have no names, but we must try, as in the other cases, to invent\nnames ourselves so that we may be clear and easy to follow. With re-\ngard to truth, then, the intermediate is a truthful sort of person and the\nmean may be called truthfulness, while the pretence which exaggerates\nis boastfulness and the person characterized by it a boaster, and that\nwhich understates is mock modesty and the person characterized by it\nmock-modest. With regard to pleasantness in the giving of amusement\nthe intermediate person is ready-witted and the disposition ready wit,\nthe excess is buffoonery and the person characterized by it a buffoon,\nwhile the man who falls short is a sort of boor and his state is boorish-\nness. With regard to the remaining kind of pleasantness, that which is\nexhibited in life in general, the man who is pleasant in the right way is\nfriendly and the mean is friendliness, while the man who exceeds is an\nobsequious person if he has no end in view, a flatterer if he is aiming at\nhis own advantage, and the man who falls short and is unpleasant in all\ncircumstances is a quarrelsome and surly sort of person.\nThere are also means in the passions and concerned with the pas-\nsions; since shame is not a virtue, and yet praise is extended to the\nmodest man. For even in these matters one man is said to be intermedi-\nate, and another to exceed, as for instance the bashful man who is ashamed\nof everything; while he who falls short or is not ashamed of anything at\nall is shameless, and the intermediate person is modest. Righteous in-\ndignation is a mean between envy and spite, and these states are con-\ncerned with the pain and pleasure that are felt at the fortunes of our\nneighbours; the man who is characterized by righteous indignation is\npained at undeserved good fortune, the envious man, going beyond him,\nis pained at all good fortune, and the spiteful man falls so far short of\nbeing pained that he even rejoices. But these states there will be an\nopportunity of describing elsewhere; with regard to justice, since it has\nnot one simple meaning, we shall, after describing the other states, dis-\ntinguish its two kinds and say how each of them is a mean; and similarly\nwe shall treat also of the rational virtues.",

    "text": "There are three kinds of disposition, then, two of them vices, involving\nexcess and deficiency respectively, and one a virtue, viz. the mean, and\nall are in a sense opposed to all; for the extreme states are contrary both\nto the intermediate state and to each other, and the intermediate to the\nextremes; as the equal is greater relatively to the less, less relatively to\nthe greater, so the middle states are excessive relatively to the deficien-\ncies, deficient relatively to the excesses, both in passions and in actions.\nFor the brave man appears rash relatively to the coward, and cowardly\nrelatively to the rash man; and similarly the temperate man appears self-\nindulgent relatively to the insensible man, insensible relatively to the\nself-indulgent, and the liberal man prodigal relatively to the mean man,\nmean relatively to the prodigal. Hence also the people at the extremes\npush the intermediate man each over to the other, and the brave man is\ncalled rash by the coward, cowardly by the rash man, and correspond-\ningly in the other cases.\nThese states being thus opposed to one another, the greatest contra-\nriety is that of the extremes to each other, rather than to the intermedi-\nate; for these are further from each other than from the intermediate, as\nthe great is further from the small and the small from the great than both\nare from the equal. Again, to the intermediate some extremes show a\ncertain likeness, as that of rashness to courage and that of prodigality to\nliberality; but the extremes show the greatest unlikeness to each other;\nnow contraries are defined as the things that are furthest from each\nother, so that things that are further apart are more contrary.\nTo the mean in some cases the deficiency, in some the excess is\nmore opposed; e.g., it is not rashness, which is an excess, but coward-\nice, which is a deficiency, that is more opposed to courage, and not\ninsensibility, which is a deficiency, but self-indulgence, which is an ex-\ncess, that is more opposed to temperance. This happens from two rea-\nsons, one being drawn from the thing itself; for because one extreme is\nnearer and liker to the intermediate, we oppose not this but rather its\ncontrary to the intermediate. E.g., since rashness is thought liker and\nnearer to courage, and cowardice more unlike, we oppose rather the\nlatter to courage; for things that are further from the intermediate are\nthought more contrary to it. This, then, is one cause, drawn from the\nthing itself; another is drawn from ourselves; for the things to which we\nourselves more naturally tend seem more contrary to the intermediate.\nFor instance, we ourselves tend more naturally to pleasures, and hence\nare more easily carried away towards self-indulgence than towards pro-\npriety. We describe as contrary to the mean, then, rather the directions\nin which we more often go to great lengths; and therefore self-indul-\ngence, which is an excess, is the more contrary to temperance.",

    "text": "That moral virtue is a mean, then, and in what sense it is so, and that it\nis a mean between two vices, the one involving excess, the other defi-\nciency, and that it is such because its character is to aim at what is\nintermediate in passions and in actions, has been sufficiently stated.\nHence also it is no easy task to be good. For in everything it is no easy\ntask to find the middle, e.g., to find the middle of a circle is not for every\none but for him who knows; so, too, any one can get angry—that is\neasy—or give or spend money; but to do this to the right person, to the\nright extent, at the right time, with the right motive, and in the right way,\nthat is not for every one, nor is it easy; wherefore goodness is both rare\nand laudable and noble.\nHence he who aims at the intermediate must first depart from what\nis the more contrary to it, as Calypso advises—\nHold the ship out beyond that surf and spray.\nFor of the extremes one is more erroneous, one less so; therefore,\nsince to hit the mean is hard in the extreme, we must as a second best, as\npeople say, take the least of the evils; and this will be done best in the\nway we describe. But we must consider the things towards which we\nourselves also are easily carried away; for some of us tend to one thing,\nsome to another; and this will be recognizable from the pleasure and the\npain we feel. We must drag ourselves away to the contrary extreme; for\nwe shall get into the intermediate state by drawing well away from er-\nror, as people do in straightening sticks that are bent.\nNow in everything the pleasant or pleasure is most to be guarded\nagainst; for we do not judge it impartially. We ought, then, to feel to-\nwards pleasure as the elders of the people felt towards Helen, and in all\ncircumstances repeat their saying; for if we dismiss pleasure thus we\nare less likely to go astray. It is by doing this, then, (to sum the matter\nup) that we shall best be able to hit the mean.\nBut this is no doubt difficult, and especially in individual cases; for\nor is not easy to determine both how and with whom and on what provo-\ncation and how long one should be angry; for we too sometimes praise\nthose who fall short and call them good-tempered, but sometimes we\npraise those who get angry and call them manly. The man, however,\nwho deviates little from goodness is not blamed, whether he do so in the\ndirection of the more or of the less, but only the man who deviates more\nwidely; for he does not fail to be noticed. But up to what point and to\nwhat extent a man must deviate before he becomes blameworthy it is\nnot easy to determine by reasoning, any more than anything else that is\nperceived by the senses; such things depend on particular facts, and the\ndecision rests with perception. So much, then, is plain, that the interme-\ndiate state is in all things to be praised, but that we must incline some-\ntimes towards the excess, sometimes towards the deficiency; for so shall\nwe most easily hit the mean and what is right.",

    "text": "Since virtue is concerned with passions and actions, and on voluntary\npassions and actions praise and blame are bestowed, on those that are\ninvoluntary pardon, and sometimes also pity, to distinguish the volun-\ntary and the involuntary is presumably necessary for those who are\nstudying the nature of virtue, and useful also for legislators with a view\nto the assigning both of honours and of punishments. Those things, then,\nare thought-involuntary, which take place under compulsion or owing\nto ignorance; and that is compulsory of which the moving principle is\noutside, being a principle in which nothing is contributed by the person\nwho is acting or is feeling the passion, e.g., if he were to be carried\nsomewhere by a wind, or by men who had him in their power.\nBut with regard to the things that are done from fear of greater evils\nor for some noble object (e.g., if a tyrant were to order one to do some-\nthing base, having one’s parents and children in his power, and if one\ndid the action they were to be saved, but otherwise would be put to\ndeath), it may be debated whether such actions are involuntary or vol-\nuntary. Something of the sort happens also with regard to the throwing\nof goods overboard in a storm; for in the abstract no one throws goods\naway voluntarily, but on condition of its securing the safety of himself\nand his crew any sensible man does so. Such actions, then, are mixed,\nbut are more like voluntary actions; for they are worthy of choice at the\ntime when they are done, and the end of an action is relative to the\noccasion. Both the terms, then, ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary,’ must be\nused with reference to the moment of action. Now the man acts volun-\ntarily; for the principle that moves the instrumental parts of the body in\nsuch actions is in him, and the things of which the moving principle is in\na man himself are in his power to do or not to do. Such actions, there-\nfore, are voluntary, but in the abstract perhaps involuntary; for no one\nwould choose any such act in itself.\nFor such actions men are sometimes even praised, when they en-\ndure something base or painful in return for great and noble objects\ngained; in the opposite case they are blamed, since to endure the greatest\nindignities for no noble end or for a trifling end is the mark of an inferior\nperson. On some actions praise indeed is not bestowed, but pardon is,\nwhen one does what he ought not under pressure which overstrains hu-\nman nature and which no one could withstand. But some acts, perhaps,\nwe cannot be forced to do, but ought rather to face death after the most\nfearful sufferings; for the things that ‘forced’ Euripides Alcmaeon to\nslay his mother seem absurd. It is difficult sometimes to determine what\nshould be chosen at what cost, and what should be endured in return for\nwhat gain, and yet more difficult to abide by our decisions; for as a rule\nwhat is expected is painful, and what we are forced to do is base, whence\npraise and blame are bestowed on those who have been compelled or\nhave not.\nWhat sort of acts, then, should be called compulsory? We answer\nthat without qualification actions are so when the cause is in the exter-\nnal circumstances and the agent contributes nothing. But the things that\nin themselves are involuntary, but now and in return for these gains are\nworthy of choice, and whose moving principle is in the agent, are in\nthemselves involuntary, but now and in return for these gains voluntary.\nThey are more like voluntary acts; for actions are in the class of particu-\nlars, and the particular acts here are voluntary. What sort of things are\nto be chosen, and in return for what, it is not easy to state; for there are\nmany differences in the particular cases.\nBut if some one were to say that pleasant and noble objects have a\ncompelling power, forcing us from without, all acts would be for him\ncompulsory; for it is for these objects that all men do everything they\ndo. And those who act under compulsion and unwillingly act with pain,\nbut those who do acts for their pleasantness and nobility do them with\npleasure; it is absurd to make external circumstances responsible, and\nnot oneself, as being easily caught by such attractions, and to make\noneself responsible for noble acts but the pleasant objects responsible\nfor base acts. The compulsory, then, seems to be that whose moving\nprinciple is outside, the person compelled contributing nothing.\nEverything that is done by reason of ignorance is not voluntary; it is\nonly what produces pain and repentance that is involuntary. For the\nman who has done something owing to ignorance, and feels not the least\nvexation at his action, has not acted voluntarily, since he did not know\nwhat he was doing, nor yet involuntarily, since he is not pained. Of\npeople, then, who act by reason of ignorance he who repents is thought\nan involuntary agent, and the man who does not repent may, since he is\ndifferent, be called a not voluntary agent; for, since he differs from the\nother, it is better that he should have a name of his own.\nActing by reason of ignorance seems also to be different from act-\ning in ignorance; for the man who is drunk or in a rage is thought to act\nas a result not of ignorance but of one of the causes mentioned, yet not\nknowingly but in ignorance.\nNow every wicked man is ignorant of what he ought to do and what\nhe ought to abstain from, and it is by reason of error of this kind that\nmen become unjust and in general bad; but the term ‘involuntary’ tends\nto be used not if a man is ignorant of what is to his advantage—for it is\nnot mistaken purpose that causes involuntary action (it leads rather to\nwickedness), nor ignorance of the universal (for that men are blamed),\nbut ignorance of particulars, i.e., of the circumstances of the action and\nthe objects with which it is concerned. For it is on these that both pity\nand pardon depend, since the person who is ignorant of any of these acts\ninvoluntarily.\nPerhaps it is just as well, therefore, to determine their nature and\nnumber. A man may be ignorant, then, of who he is, what he is doing,\nwhat or whom he is acting on, and sometimes also what (e.g., what\ninstrument) he is doing it with, and to what end (e.g., he may think his\nact will conduce to some one’s safety), and how he is doing it (e.g.,\nwhether gently or violently). Now of all of these no one could be igno-\nrant unless he were mad, and evidently also he could not be ignorant of\nthe agent; for how could he not know himself? But of what he is doing a\nman might be ignorant, as for instance people say ‘it slipped out of their\nmouths as they were speaking,’ or ‘they did not know it was a secret,’ as\nAeschylus said of the mysteries, or a man might say he ‘let it go off\nwhen he merely wanted to show its working,’ as the man did with the\ncatapult. Again, one might think one’s son was an enemy, as Merope\ndid, or that a pointed spear had a button on it, or that a stone was\npumicestone; or one might give a man a draught to save him, and really\nkill him; or one might want to touch a man, as people do in sparring, and\nreally wound him. The ignorance may relate, then, to any of these things,\ni.e., of the circumstances of the action, and the man who was ignorant of\nany of these is thought to have acted involuntarily, and especially if he\nwas ignorant on the most important points; and these are thought to be\nthe circumstances of the action and its end. Further, the doing of an act\nthat is called involuntary in virtue of ignorance of this sort must be\npainful and involve repentance.\nSince that which is done under compulsion or by reason of igno-\nrance is involuntary, the voluntary would seem to be that of which the\nmoving principle is in the agent himself, he being aware of the particu-\nlar circumstances of the action. Presumably acts done by reason of an-\nger or appetite are not rightly called involuntary. For in the first place,\non that showing none of the other animals will act voluntarily, nor will\nchildren; and secondly, is it meant that we do not do voluntarily any of\nthe acts that are due to appetite or anger, or that we do the noble acts\nvoluntarily and the base acts involuntarily? Is not this absurd, when one\nand the same thing is the cause? But it would surely be odd to describe\nas involuntary the things one ought to desire; and we ought both to be\nangry at certain things and to have an appetite for certain things, e.g.,\nfor health and for learning. Also what is involuntary is thought to be\npainful, but what is in accordance with appetite is thought to be pleas-\nant. Again, what is the difference in respect of involuntariness between\nerrors committed upon calculation and those committed in anger? Both\nare to be avoided, but the irrational passions are thought not less human\nthan reason is, and therefore also the actions which proceed from anger\nor appetite are the man’s actions. It would be odd, then, to treat them as\ninvoluntary.",

    "text": "Both the voluntary and the involuntary having been delimited, we must\nnext discuss choice; for it is thought to be most closely bound up with\nvirtue and to discriminate characters better than actions do.\nChoice, then, seems to be voluntary, but not the same thing as the\nvoluntary; the latter extends more widely. For both children and the\nlower animals share in voluntary action, but not in choice, and acts done\non the spur of the moment we describe as voluntary, but not as chosen.\nThose who say it is appetite or anger or wish or a kind of opinion do\nnot seem to be right. For choice is not common to irrational creatures as\nwell, but appetite and anger are. Again, the incontinent man acts with\nappetite, but not with choice; while the continent man on the contrary\nacts with choice, but not with appetite. Again, appetite is contrary to\nchoice, but not appetite to appetite. Again, appetite relates to the pleas-\nant and the painful, choice neither to the painful nor to the pleasant.\nStill less is it anger; for acts due to anger are thought to be less than\nany others objects of choice.\nBut neither is it wish, though it seems near to it; for choice cannot\nrelate to impossibles, and if any one said he chose them he would be\nthought silly; but there may be a wish even for impossibles, e.g., for\nimmortality. And wish may relate to things that could in no way be\nbrought about by one’s own efforts, e.g., that a particular actor or ath-\nlete should win in a competition; but no one chooses such things, but\nonly the things that he thinks could be brought about by his own efforts.\nAgain, wish relates rather to the end, choice to the means; for instance,\nwe wish to be healthy, but we choose the acts which will make us healthy,\nand we wish to be happy and say we do, but we cannot well say we\nchoose to be so; for, in general, choice seems to relate to the things that\nare in our own power.\nFor this reason, too, it cannot be opinion; for opinion is thought to\nrelate to all kinds of things, no less to eternal things and impossible\nthings than to things in our own power; and it is distinguished by its\nfalsity or truth, not by its badness or goodness, while choice is distin-\nguished rather by these.\nNow with opinion in general perhaps no one even says it is identi-\ncal. But it is not identical even with any kind of opinion; for by choosing\nwhat is good or bad we are men of a certain character, which we are not\nby holding certain opinions. And we choose to get or avoid something\ngood or bad, but we have opinions about what a thing is or whom it is\ngood for or how it is good for him; we can hardly be said to opine to get\nor avoid anything. And choice is praised for being related to the right\nobject rather than for being rightly related to it, opinion for being truly\nrelated to its object. And we choose what we best know to be good, but\nwe opine what we do not quite know; and it is not the same people that\nare thought to make the best choices and to have the best opinions, but\nsome are thought to have fairly good opinions, but by reason of vice to\nchoose what they should not. If opinion precedes choice or accompanies\nit, that makes no difference; for it is not this that we are considering, but\nwhether it is identical with some kind of opinion.\nWhat, then, or what kind of thing is it, since it is none of the things\nwe have mentioned? It seems to be voluntary, but not all that is volun-\ntary to be an object of choice. Is it, then, what has been decided on by\nprevious deliberation? At any rate choice involves a rational principle\nand thought. Even the name seems to suggest that it is what is chosen\nbefore other things.",

    "text": "Do we deliberate about everything, and is everything a possible subject\nof deliberation, or is deliberation impossible about some things? We\nought presumably to call not what a fool or a madman would deliberate\nabout, but what a sensible man would deliberate about, a subject of\ndeliberation. Now about eternal things no one deliberates, e.g., about\nthe material universe or the incommensurability of the diagonal and the\nside of a square. But no more do we deliberate about the things that\ninvolve movement but always happen in the same way, whether of ne-\ncessity or by nature or from any other cause, e.g., the solstices and the\nrisings of the stars; nor about things that happen now in one way, now in\nanother, e.g., droughts and rains; nor about chance events, like the find-\ning of treasure. But we do not deliberate even about all human affairs;\nfor instance, no Spartan deliberates about the best constitution for the\nScythians. For none of these things can be brought about by our own\nefforts.\nWe deliberate about things that are in our power and can be done;\nand these are in fact what is left. For nature, necessity, and chance are\nthought to be causes, and also reason and everything that depends on\nman. Now every class of men deliberates about the things that can be\ndone by their own efforts. And in the case of exact and self-contained\nsciences there is no deliberation, e.g., about the letters of the alphabet\n(for we have no doubt how they should be written); but the things that\nare brought about by our own efforts, but not always in the same way,\nare the things about which we deliberate, e.g., questions of medical treat-\nment or of money-making. And we do so more in the case of the art of\nnavigation than in that of gymnastics, inasmuch as it has been less ex-\nactly worked out, and again about other things in the same ratio, and\nmore also in the case of the arts than in that of the sciences; for we have\nmore doubt about the former. Deliberation is concerned with things that\nhappen in a certain way for the most part, but in which the event is\nobscure, and with things in which it is indeterminate. We call in others\nto aid us in deliberation on important questions, distrusting ourselves as\nnot being equal to deciding.\nWe deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does\nnot deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall per-\nsuade, nor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor does\nany one else deliberate about his end. They assume the end and consider\nhow and by what means it is to be attained; and if it seems to be pro-\nduced by several means they consider by which it is most easily and best\nproduced, while if it is achieved by one only they consider how it will be\nachieved by this and by what means this will be achieved, till they come\nto the first cause, which in the order of discovery is last. For the person\nwho deliberates seems to investigate and analyse in the way described\nas though he were analysing a geometrical construction (not all investi-\ngation appears to be deliberation—for instance mathematical investiga-\ntions—but all deliberation is investigation), and what is last in the order\nof analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. And if we come\non an impossibility, we give up the search, e.g., if we need money and\nthis cannot be got; but if a thing appears possible we try to do it. By\n‘possible’ things I mean things that might be brought about by our own\nefforts; and these in a sense include things that can be brought about by\nthe efforts of our friends, since the moving principle is in ourselves. The\nsubject of investigation is sometimes the instruments, sometimes the use\nof them; and similarly in the other cases—sometimes the means, some-\ntimes the mode of using it or the means of bringing it about. It seems,\nthen, as has been said, that man is a moving principle of actions; now\ndeliberation is about the things to be done by the agent himself, and\nactions are for the sake of things other than themselves. For the end\ncannot be a subject of deliberation, but only the means; nor indeed can\nthe particular facts be a subject of it, as whether this is bread or has\nbeen baked as it should; for these are matters of perception. If we are to\nbe always deliberating, we shall have to go on to infinity.\nThe same thing is deliberated upon and is chosen, except that the\nobject of choice is already determinate, since it is that which has been\ndecided upon as a result of deliberation that is the object of choice. For\nevery one ceases to inquire how he is to act when he has brought the\nmoving principle back to himself and to the ruling part of himself; for\nthis is what chooses. This is plain also from the ancient constitutions,\nwhich Homer represented; for the kings announced their choices to the\npeople. The object of choice being one of the things in our own power\nwhich is desired after deliberation, choice will be deliberate desire of\nthings in our own power; for when we have decided as a result of delib-\neration, we desire in accordance with our deliberation.\nWe may take it, then, that we have described choice in outline, and\nstated the nature of its objects and the fact that it is concerned with\nmeans.",

    "text": "That wish is for the end has already been stated; some think it is for the\ngood, others for the apparent good. Now those who say that the good is\nthe object of wish must admit in consequence that that which the man\nwho does not choose aright wishes for is not an object of wish (for if it\nis to be so, it must also be good; but it was, if it so happened, bad); while\nthose who say the apparent good is the object of wish must admit that\nthere is no natural object of wish, but only what seems good to each\nman. Now different things appear good to different people, and, if it so\nhappens, even contrary things.\nIf these consequences are unpleasing, are we to say that absolutely\nand in truth the good is the object of wish, but for each person the\napparent good; that that which is in truth an object of wish is an object\nof wish to the good man, while any chance thing may be so the bad man,\nas in the case of bodies also the things that are in truth wholesome are\nwholesome for bodies which are in good condition, while for those that\nare diseased other things are wholesome—or bitter or sweet or hot or\nheavy, and so on; since the good man judges each class of things rightly,\nand in each the truth appears to him? For each state of character has its\nown ideas of the noble and the pleasant, and perhaps the good man\ndiffers from others most by seeing the truth in each class of things,\nbeing as it were the norm and measure of them. In most things the error\nseems to be due to pleasure; for it appears a good when it is not. We\ntherefore choose the pleasant as a good, and avoid pain as an evil.",

    "text": "The end, then, being what we wish for, the means what we deliberate\nabout and choose, actions concerning means must be according to choice\nand voluntary. Now the exercise of the virtues is concerned with means.\nTherefore virtue also is in our own power, and so too vice. For where it\nis in our power to act it is also in our power not to act, and vice versa; so\nthat, if to act, where this is noble, is in our power, not to act, which will\nbe base, will also be in our power, and if not to act, where this is noble,\nis in our power, to act, which will be base, will also be in our power.\nNow if it is in our power to do noble or base acts, and likewise in our\npower not to do them, and this was what being good or bad meant, then\nit is in our power to be virtuous or vicious.\nThe saying that ‘no one is voluntarily wicked nor involuntarily happy’\nseems to be partly false and partly true; for no one is involuntarily happy,\nbut wickedness is voluntary. Or else we shall have to dispute what has\njust been said, at any rate, and deny that man is a moving principle or\nbegetter of his actions as of children. But if these facts are evident and\nwe cannot refer actions to moving principles other than those in our-\nselves, the acts whose moving principles are in us must themselves also\nbe in our power and voluntary.\nWitness seems to be borne to this both by individuals in their pri-\nvate capacity and by legislators themselves; for these punish and take\nvengeance on those who do wicked acts (unless they have acted under\ncompulsion or as a result of ignorance for which they are not themselves\nresponsible), while they honour those who do noble acts, as though they\nmeant to encourage the latter and deter the former. But no one is encour-\naged to do the things that are neither in our power nor voluntary; it is\nassumed that there is no gain in being persuaded not to be hot or in pain\nor hungry or the like, since we shall experience these feelings none the\nless. Indeed, we punish a man for his very ignorance, if he is thought\nresponsible for the ignorance, as when penalties are doubled in the case\nof drunkenness; for the moving principle is in the man himself, since he\nhad the power of not getting drunk and his getting drunk was the cause\nof his ignorance. And we punish those who are ignorant of anything in\nthe laws that they ought to know and that is not difficult, and so too in\nthe case of anything else that they are thought to be ignorant of through\ncarelessness; we assume that it is in their power not to be ignorant, since\nthey have the power of taking care.\nBut perhaps a man is the kind of man not to take care. Still they are\nthemselves by their slack lives responsible for becoming men of that\nkind, and men make themselves responsible for being unjust or self-\nindulgent, in the one case by cheating and in the other by spending their\ntime in drinking bouts and the like; for it is activities exercised on par-\nticular objects that make the corresponding character. This is plain from\nthe case of people training for any contest or action; they practise the\nactivity the whole time. Now not to know that it is from the exercise of\nactivities on particular objects that states of character are produced is\nthe mark of a thoroughly senseless person. Again, it is irrational to sup-\npose that a man who acts unjustly does not wish to be unjust or a man\nwho acts self-indulgently to be self-indulgent. But if without being igno-\nrant a man does the things which will make him unjust, he will be unjust\nvoluntarily. Yet it does not follow that if he wishes he will cease to be\nunjust and will be just. For neither does the man who is ill become well\non those terms. We may suppose a case in which he is ill voluntarily,\nthrough living incontinently and disobeying his doctors. In that case it\nwas then open to him not to be ill, but not now, when he has thrown\naway his chance, just as when you have let a stone go it is too late to\nrecover it; but yet it was in your power to throw it, since the moving\nprinciple was in you. So, too, to the unjust and to the self-indulgent man\nit was open at the beginning not to become men of this kind, and so they\nare unjust and selfindulgent voluntarily; but now that they have become\nso it is not possible for them not to be so.\nBut not only are the vices of the soul voluntary, but those of the\nbody also for some men, whom we accordingly blame; while no one\nblames those who are ugly by nature, we blame those who are so owing\nto want of exercise and care. So it is, too, with respect to weakness and\ninfirmity; no one would reproach a man blind from birth or by disease\nor from a blow, but rather pity him, while every one would blame a man\nwho was blind from drunkenness or some other form of self-indulgence.\nOf vices of the body, then, those in our own power are blamed, those not\nin our power are not. And if this be so, in the other cases also the vices\nthat are blamed must be in our own power.\nNow some one may say that all men desire the apparent good, but\nhave no control over the appearance, but the end appears to each man in\na form answering to his character. We reply that if each man is some-\nhow responsible for his state of mind, he will also be himself somehow\nresponsible for the appearance; but if not, no one is responsible for his\nown evildoing, but every one does evil acts through ignorance of the\nend, thinking that by these he will get what is best, and the aiming at the\nend is not self-chosen but one must be born with an eye, as it were, by\nwhich to judge rightly and choose what is truly good, and he is well\nendowed by nature who is well endowed with this. For it is what is\ngreatest and most noble, and what we cannot get or learn from another,\nbut must have just such as it was when given us at birth, and to be well\nand nobly endowed with this will be perfect and true excellence of natu-\nral endowment. If this is true, then, how will virtue be more voluntary\nthan vice? To both men alike, the good and the bad, the end appears and\nis fixed by nature or however it may be, and it is by referring everything\nelse to this that men do whatever they do.\nWhether, then, it is not by nature that the end appears to each man\nsuch as it does appear, but something also depends on him, or the end is\nnatural but because the good man adopts the means voluntarily virtue is\nvoluntary, vice also will be none the less voluntary; for in the case of the\nbad man there is equally present that which depends on himself in his\nactions even if not in his end. If, then, as is asserted, the virtues are\nvoluntary (for we are ourselves somehow partly responsible for our\nstates of character, and it is by being persons of a certain kind that we\nassume the end to be so and so), the vices also will be voluntary; for the\nsame is true of them.\nWith regard to the virtues in general we have stated their genus in\noutline, viz. that they are means and that they are states of character,\nand that they tend, and by their own nature, to the doing of the acts by\nwhich they are produced, and that they are in our power and voluntary,\nand act as the right rule prescribes. But actions and states of character\nare not voluntary in the same way; for we are masters of our actions\nfrom the beginning right to the end, if we know the particular facts, but\nthough we control the beginning of our states of character the gradual\nprogress is not obvious any more than it is in illnesses; because it was in\nour power, however, to act in this way or not in this way, therefore the\nstates are voluntary.\nLet us take up the several virtues, however, and say which they are\nand what sort of things they are concerned with and how they are con-\ncerned with them; at the same time it will become plain how many they\nare. And first let us speak of courage.",

    "text": "That it is a mean with regard to feelings of fear and confidence has\nalready been made evident; and plainly the things we fear are terrible\nthings, and these are, to speak without qualification, evils; for which\nreason people even define fear as expectation of evil. Now we fear all\nevils, e.g., disgrace, poverty, disease, friendlessness, death, but the brave\nman is not thought to be concerned with all; for to fear some things is\neven right and noble, and it is base not to fear them—e.g., disgrace; he\nwho fears this is good and modest, and he who does not is shameless. He\nis, however, by some people called brave, by a transference of the word\nto a new meaning; for he has in him something which is like the brave\nman, since the brave man also is a fearless person. Poverty and disease\nwe perhaps ought not to fear, nor in general the things that do not pro-\nceed from vice and are not due to a man himself. But not even the man\nwho is fearless of these is brave. Yet we apply the word to him also in\nvirtue of a similarity; for some who in the dangers of war are cowards\nare liberal and are confident in face of the loss of money. Nor is a man\na coward if he fears insult to his wife and children or envy or anything\nof the kind; nor brave if he is confident when he is about to be flogged.\nWith what sort of terrible things, then, is the brave man concerned?\nSurely with the greatest; for no one is more likely than he to stand his\nground against what is awe-inspiring. Now death is the most terrible of\nall things; for it is the end, and nothing is thought to be any longer either\ngood or bad for the dead. But the brave man would not seem to be\nconcerned even with death in all circumstances, e.g., at sea or in dis-\nease. In what circumstances, then? Surely in the noblest. Now such\ndeaths are those in battle; for these take place in the greatest and noblest\ndanger. And these are correspondingly honoured in city-states and at the\ncourts of monarchs. Properly, then, he will be called brave who is fear-\nless in face of a noble death, and of all emergencies that involve death;\nand the emergencies of war are in the highest degree of this kind. Yet at\nsea also, and in disease, the brave man is fearless, but not in the same\nway as the seaman; for he has given up hope of safety, and is disliking\nthe thought of death in this shape, while they are hopeful because of\ntheir experience. At the same time, we show courage in situations where\nthere is the opportunity of showing prowess or where death is noble; but\nin these forms of death neither of these conditions is fulfilled.",

    "text": "What is terrible is not the same for all men; but we say there are things\nterrible even beyond human strength. These, then, are terrible to every\none—at least to every sensible man; but the terrible things that are not\nbeyond human strength differ in magnitude and degree, and so too do\nthe things that inspire confidence. Now the brave man is as dauntless as\nman may be. Therefore, while he will fear even the things that are not\nbeyond human strength, he will face them as he ought and as the rule\ndirects, for honour’s sake; for this is the end of virtue. But it is possible\nto fear these more, or less, and again to fear things that are not terrible\nas if they were. Of the faults that are committed one consists in fearing\nwhat one should not, another in fearing as we should not, another in\nfearing when we should not, and so on; and so too with respect to the\nthings that inspire confidence. The man, then, who faces and who fears\nthe right things and from the right motive, in the right way and from the\nright time, and who feels confidence under the corresponding condi-\ntions, is brave; for the brave man feels and acts according to the merits\nof the case and in whatever way the rule directs. Now the end of every\nactivity is conformity to the corresponding state of character. This is\ntrue, therefore, of the brave man as well as of others. But courage is\nnoble. Therefore the end also is noble; for each thing is defined by its\nend. Therefore it is for a noble end that the brave man endures and acts\nas courage directs.\nOf those who go to excess he who exceeds in fearlessness has no\nname (we have said previously that many states of character have no\nnames), but he would be a sort of madman or insensible person if he\nfeared nothing, neither earthquakes nor the waves, as they say the Celts\ndo not; while the man who exceeds in confidence about what really is\nterrible is rash. The rash man, however, is also thought to be boastful\nand only a pretender to courage; at all events, as the brave man is with\nregard to what is terrible, so the rash man wishes to appear; and so he\nimitates him in situations where he can. Hence also most of them are a\nmixture of rashness and cowardice; for, while in these situations they\ndisplay confidence, they do not hold their ground against what is really\nterrible. The man who exceeds in fear is a coward; for he fears both\nwhat he ought not and as he ought not, and all the similar characteriza-\ntions attach to him. He is lacking also in confidence; but he is more\nconspicuous for his excess of fear in painful situations. The coward,\nthen, is a despairing sort of person; for he fears everything. The brave\nman, on the other hand, has the opposite disposition; for confidence is\nthe mark of a hopeful disposition. The coward, the rash man, and the\nbrave man, then, are concerned with the same objects but are differently\ndisposed towards them; for the first two exceed and fall short, while the\nthird holds the middle, which is the right, position; and rash men are\nprecipitate, and wish for dangers beforehand but draw back when they\nare in them, while brave men are keen in the moment of action, but quiet\nbeforehand.\nAs we have said, then, courage is a mean with respect to things that\ninspire confidence or fear, in the circumstances that have been stated;\nand it chooses or endures things because it is noble to do so, or because\nit is base not to do so. But to die to escape from poverty or love or\nanything painful is not the mark of a brave man, but rather of a coward;\nfor it is softness to fly from what is troublesome, and such a man en-\ndures death not because it is noble but to fly from evil.",

    "text": "Courage, then, is something of this sort, but the name is also applied to\nfive other kinds.\nFirst comes the courage of the citizen-soldier; for this is most like\ntrue courage. Citizen-soldiers seem to face dangers because of the pen-\nalties imposed by the laws and the reproaches they would otherwise\nincur, and because of the honours they win by such action; and therefore\nthose peoples seem to be bravest among whom cowards are held in\ndishonour and brave men in honour. This is the kind of courage that\nHomer depicts, e.g., in Diomede and in Hector:\nFirst will Polydamas be to heap reproach on me then; and\nFor Hector one day ‘mid the Trojans shall utter his vaulting harangue:\nAfraid was Tydeides, and fled from my face.\nThis kind of courage is most like to that which we described earlier,\nbecause it is due to virtue; for it is due to shame and to desire of a noble\nobject (i.e., honour) and avoidance of disgrace, which is ignoble. One\nmight rank in the same class even those who are compelled by their\nrulers; but they are inferior, inasmuch as they do what they do not from\nshame but from fear, and to avoid not what is disgraceful but what is\npainful; for their masters compel them, as Hector does:\nBut if I shall spy any dastard that cowers far from the fight,\nVainly will such an one hope to escape from the dogs.\nAnd those who give them their posts, and beat them if they retreat,\ndo the same, and so do those who draw them up with trenches or some-\nthing of the sort behind them; all of these apply compulsion. But one\nought to be brave not under compulsion but because it is noble to be so.\n(2) Experience with regard to particular facts is also thought to be\ncourage; this is indeed the reason why Socrates thought courage was\nknowledge. Other people exhibit this quality in other dangers, and pro-\nfessional soldiers exhibit it in the dangers of war; for there seem to be\nmany empty alarms in war, of which these have had the most compre-\nhensive experience; therefore they seem brave, because the others do\nnot know the nature of the facts. Again, their experience makes them\nmost capable in attack and in defence, since they can use their arms and\nhave the kind that are likely to be best both for attack and for defence;\ntherefore they fight like armed men against unarmed or like trained ath-\nletes against amateurs; for in such contests too it is not the bravest men\nthat fight best, but those who are strongest and have their bodies in the\nbest condition. Professional soldiers turn cowards, however, when the\ndanger puts too great a strain on them and they are inferior in numbers\nand equipment; for they are the first to fly, while citizen-forces die at\ntheir posts, as in fact happened at the temple of Hermes. For to the latter\nflight is disgraceful and death is preferable to safety on those terms;\nwhile the former from the very beginning faced the danger on the as-\nsumption that they were stronger, and when they know the facts they fly,\nfearing death more than disgrace; but the brave man is not that sort of\nperson.\n(3) Passion also is sometimes reckoned as courage; those who act\nfrom passion, like wild beasts rushing at those who have wounded them,\nare thought to be brave, because brave men also are passionate; for\npassion above all things is eager to rush on danger, and hence Homer’s\n‘put strength into his passion’ and ‘aroused their spirit and passion and\n‘hard he breathed panting’ and ‘his blood boiled’. For all such expres-\nsions seem to indicate the stirring and onset of passion. Now brave men\nact for honour’s sake, but passion aids them; while wild beasts act un-\nder the influence of pain; for they attack because they have been wounded\nor because they are afraid, since if they are in a forest they do not come\nnear one. Thus they are not brave because, driven by pain and passion,\nthey rush on danger without foreseeing any of the perils, since at that\nrate even asses would be brave when they are hungry; for blows will not\ndrive them from their food; and lust also makes adulterers do many\ndaring things. (Those creatures are not brave, then, which are driven on\nto danger by pain or passion.) The ‘courage’ that is due to passion\nseems to be the most natural, and to be courage if choice and motive be\nadded.\nMen, then, as well as beasts, suffer pain when they are angry, and\nare pleased when they exact their revenge; those who fight for these\nreasons, however, are pugnacious but not brave; for they do not act for\nhonour’s sake nor as the rule directs, but from strength of feeling; they\nhave, however, something akin to courage.\n(4) Nor are sanguine people brave; for they are confident in danger\nonly because they have conquered often and against many foes. Yet they\nclosely resemble brave men, because both are confident; but brave men\nare confident for the reasons stated earlier, while these are so because\nthey think they are the strongest and can suffer nothing. (Drunken men\nalso behave in this way; they become sanguine). When their adventures\ndo not succeed, however, they run away; but it was the mark of a brave\nman to face things that are, and seem, terrible for a man, because it is\nnoble to do so and disgraceful not to do so. Hence also it is thought the\nmark of a braver man to be fearless and undisturbed in sudden alarms\nthan to be so in those that are foreseen; for it must have proceeded more\nfrom a state of character, because less from preparation; acts that are\nforeseen may be chosen by calculation and rule, but sudden actions\nmust be in accordance with one’s state of character.\n(5) People who are ignorant of the danger also appear brave, and\nthey are not far removed from those of a sanguine temper, but are infe-\nrior inasmuch as they have no self-reliance while these have. Hence also\nthe sanguine hold their ground for a time; but those who have been\ndeceived about the facts fly if they know or suspect that these are differ-\nent from what they supposed, as happened to the Argives when they fell\nin with the Spartans and took them for Sicyonians.\nWe have, then, described the character both of brave men and of\nthose who are thought to be brave.",

    "text": "Though courage is concerned with feelings of confidence and of fear, it\nis not concerned with both alike, but more with the things that inspire\nfear; for he who is undisturbed in face of these and bears himself as he\nshould towards these is more truly brave than the man who does so\ntowards the things that inspire confidence. It is for facing what is pain-\nful, then, as has been said, that men are called brave. Hence also cour-\nage involves pain, and is justly praised; for it is harder to face what is\npainful than to abstain from what is pleasant.\nYet the end which courage sets before it would seem to be pleasant,\nbut to be concealed by the attending circumstances, as happens also in\nathletic contests; for the end at which boxers aim is pleasant—the crown\nand the honours—but the blows they take are distressing to flesh and\nblood, and painful, and so is their whole exertion; and because the blows\nand the exertions are many the end, which is but small, appears to have\nnothing pleasant in it. And so, if the case of courage is similar, death\nand wounds will be painful to the brave man and against his will, but he\nwill face them because it is noble to do so or because it is base not to do\nso. And the more he is possessed of virtue in its entirety and the happier\nhe is, the more he will be pained at the thought of death; for life is best\nworth living for such a man, and he is knowingly losing the greatest\ngoods, and this is painful. But he is none the less brave, and perhaps all\nthe more so, because he chooses noble deeds of war at that cost. It is not\nthe case, then, with all the virtues that the exercise of them is pleasant,\nexcept in so far as it reaches its end. But it is quite possible that the best\nsoldiers may be not men of this sort but those who are less brave but\nhave no other good; for these are ready to face danger, and they sell their\nlife for trifling gains.\nSo much, then, for courage; it is not difficult to grasp its nature in\noutline, at any rate, from what has been said.",

    "text": "After courage let us speak of temperance; for these seem to be the vir-\ntues of the irrational parts. We have said that temperance is a mean with\nregard to pleasures (for it is less, and not in the same way, concerned\nwith pains); self-indulgence also is manifested in the same sphere. Now,\ntherefore, let us determine with what sort of pleasures they are con-\ncerned. We may assume the distinction between bodily pleasures and\nthose of the soul, such as love of honour and love of learning; for the\nlover of each of these delights in that of which he is a lover, the body\nbeing in no way affected, but rather the mind; but men who are con-\ncerned with such pleasures are called neither temperate nor self-indul-\ngent. Nor, again, are those who are concerned with the other pleasures\nthat are not bodily; for those who are fond of hearing and telling stories\nand who spend their days on anything that turns up are called gossips,\nbut not self-indulgent, nor are those who are pained at the loss of money\nor of friends.\nTemperance must be concerned with bodily pleasures, but not all\neven of these; for those who delight in objects of vision, such as colours\nand shapes and painting, are called neither temperate nor self-indulgent;\nyet it would seem possible to delight even in these either as one should\nor to excess or to a deficient degree.\nAnd so too is it with objects of hearing; no one calls those who\ndelight extravagantly in music or acting self-indulgent, nor those who\ndo so as they ought temperate.\nNor do we apply these names to those who delight in odour, unless\nit be incidentally; we do not call those self-indulgent who delight in the\nodour of apples or roses or incense, but rather those who delight in the\nodour of unguents or of dainty dishes; for self-indulgent people delight\nin these because these remind them of the objects of their appetite. And\none may see even other people, when they are hungry, delighting in the\nsmell of food; but to delight in this kind of thing is the mark of the self-\nindulgent man; for these are objects of appetite to him.\nNor is there in animals other than man any pleasure connected with\nthese senses, except incidentally. For dogs do not delight in the scent of\nhares, but in the eating of them, but the scent told them the hares were\nthere; nor does the lion delight in the lowing of the ox, but in eating it;\nbut he perceived by the lowing that it was near, and therefore appears to\ndelight in the lowing; and similarly he does not delight because he sees\n‘a stag or a wild goat,’ but because he is going to make a meal of it.\nTemperance and self-indulgence, however, are concerned with the kind\nof pleasures that the other animals share in, which therefore appear\nslavish and brutish; these are touch and taste. But even of taste they\nappear to make little or no use; for the business of taste is the discrimi-\nnating of flavours, which is done by winetasters and people who season\ndishes; but they hardly take pleasure in making these discriminations, or\nat least self-indulgent people do not, but in the actual enjoyment, which\nin all cases comes through touch, both in the case of food and in that of\ndrink and in that of sexual intercourse. This is why a certain gourmand\nprayed that his throat might become longer than a crane’s, implying that\nit was the contact that he took pleasure in. Thus the sense with which\nself-indulgence is connected is the most widely shared of the senses; and\nself-indulgence would seem to be justly a matter of reproach, because it\nattaches to us not as men but as animals. To delight in such things, then,\nand to love them above all others, is brutish. For even of the pleasures\nof touch the most liberal have been eliminated, e.g., those produced in\nthe gymnasium by rubbing and by the consequent heat; for the contact\ncharacteristic of the self-indulgent man does not affect the whole body\nbut only certain parts.",

    "text": "Of the appetites some seem to be common, others to be peculiar to indi-\nviduals and acquired; e.g., the appetite for food is natural, since every\none who is without it craves for food or drink, and sometimes for both,\nand for love also (as Homer says) if he is young and lusty; but not every\none craves for this or that kind of nourishment or love, nor for the same\nthings. Hence such craving appears to be our very own. Yet it has of\ncourse something natural about it; for different things are pleasant to\ndifferent kinds of people, and some things are more pleasant to every\none than chance objects. Now in the natural appetites few go wrong,\nand only in one direction, that of excess; for to eat or drink whatever\noffers itself till one is surfeited is to exceed the natural amount, since\nnatural appetite is the replenishment of one’s deficiency. Hence these\npeople are called belly-gods, this implying that they fill their belly be-\nyond what is right. It is people of entirely slavish character that become\nlike this. But with regard to the pleasures peculiar to individuals many\npeople go wrong and in many ways. For while the people who are ‘fond\nof so and so’ are so called because they delight either in the wrong\nthings, or more than most people do, or in the wrong way, the self-\nindulgent exceed in all three ways; they both delight in some things that\nthey ought not to delight in (since they are hateful), and if one ought to\ndelight in some of the things they delight in, they do so more than one\nought and than most men do.\nPlainly, then, excess with regard to pleasures is self-indulgence and\nis culpable; with regard to pains one is not, as in the case of courage,\ncalled temperate for facing them or self-indulgent for not doing so, but\nthe selfindulgent man is so called because he is pained more than he\nought at not getting pleasant things (even his pain being caused by plea-\nsure), and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the\nabsence of what is pleasant and at his abstinence from it.\nThe self-indulgent man, then, craves for all pleasant things or those\nthat are most pleasant, and is led by his appetite to choose these at the\ncost of everything else; hence he is pained both when he fails to get them\nand when he is merely craving for them (for appetite involves pain); but\nit seems absurd to be pained for the sake of pleasure. People who fall\nshort with regard to pleasures and delight in them less than they should\nare hardly found; for such insensibility is not human. Even the other\nanimals distinguish different kinds of food and enjoy some and not oth-\ners; and if there is any one who finds nothing pleasant and nothing more\nattractive than anything else, he must be something quite different from\na man; this sort of person has not received a name because he hardly\noccurs. The temperate man occupies a middle position with regard to\nthese objects. For he neither enjoys the things that the self-indulgent\nman enjoys most-but rather dislikes them-nor in general the things that\nhe should not, nor anything of this sort to excess, nor does he feel pain\nor craving when they are absent, or does so only to a moderate degree,\nand not more than he should, nor when he should not, and so on; but the\nthings that, being pleasant, make for health or for good condition, he\nwill desire moderately and as he should, and also other pleasant things if\nthey are not hindrances to these ends, or contrary to what is noble, or\nbeyond his means. For he who neglects these conditions loves such plea-\nsures more than they are worth, but the temperate man is not that sort of\nperson, but the sort of person that the right rule prescribes.",

    "text": "Self-indulgence is more like a voluntary state than cowardice. For the\nformer is actuated by pleasure, the latter by pain, of which the one is to\nbe chosen and the other to be avoided; and pain upsets and destroys the\nnature of the person who feels it, while pleasure does nothing of the sort.\nTherefore self-indulgence is more voluntary. Hence also it is more a\nmatter of reproach; for it is easier to become accustomed to its objects,\nsince there are many things of this sort in life, and the process of habitu-\nation to them is free from danger, while with terrible objects the reverse\nis the case. But cowardice would seem to be voluntary in a different\ndegree from its particular manifestations; for it is itself painless, but in\nthese we are upset by pain, so that we even throw down our arms and\ndisgrace ourselves in other ways; hence our acts are even thought to be\ndone under compulsion. For the self-indulgent man, on the other hand,\nthe particular acts are voluntary (for he does them with craving and\ndesire), but the whole state is less so; for no one craves to be self-indul-\ngent.\nThe name self-indulgence is applied also to childish faults; for they\nbear a certain resemblance to what we have been considering. Which is\ncalled after which, makes no difference to our present purpose; plainly,\nhowever, the later is called after the earlier. The transference of the\nname seems not a bad one; for that which desires what is base and\nwhich develops quickly ought to be kept in a chastened condition, and\nthese characteristics belong above all to appetite and to the child, since\nchildren in fact live at the beck and call of appetite, and it is in them that\nthe desire for what is pleasant is strongest. If, then, it is not going to be\nobedient and subject to the ruling principle, it will go to great lengths;\nfor in an irrational being the desire for pleasure is insatiable even if it\ntries every source of gratification, and the exercise of appetite increases\nits innate force, and if appetites are strong and violent they even expel\nthe power of calculation. Hence they should be moderate and few, and\nshould in no way oppose the rational principle—and this is what we call\nan obedient and chastened state—and as the child should live according\nto the direction of his tutor, so the appetitive element should live accord-\ning to rational principle. Hence the appetitive element in a temperate\nman should harmonize with the rational principle; for the noble is the\nmark at which both aim, and the temperate man craves for the things be\nought, as he ought, as when he ought; and when he ought; and this is\nwhat rational principle directs.\nHere we conclude our account of temperance.",

    "text": "Let us speak next of liberality. It seems to be the mean with regard to\nwealth; for the liberal man is praised not in respect of military matters,\nnor of those in respect of which the temrate man is praised, nor of judi-\ncial decisions, but with regard to the giving and taking of wealth, and\nespecially in respect of giving. Now by ‘wealth’ we mean all the things\nwhose value is measured by money. Further, prodigality and meanness\nare excesses and defects with regard to wealth; and meanness we al-\nways impute to those who care more than they ought for wealth, but we\nsometimes apply the word ‘prodigality’ in a complex sense; for we call\nthose men prodigals who are incontinent and spend money on self-in-\ndulgence. Hence also they are thought the poorest characters; for they\ncombine more vices than one. Therefore the application of the word to\nthem is not its proper use; for a ‘prodigal’ means a man who has a single\nevil quality, that of wasting his substance; since a prodigal is one who is\nbeing ruined by his own fault, and the wasting of substance is thought to\nbe a sort of ruining of oneself, life being held to depend on possession of\nsubstance.\nThis, then, is the sense in which we take the word ‘prodigality’.\nNow the things that have a use may be used either well or badly; and\nriches is a useful thing; and everything is used best by the man who has\nthe virtue concerned with it; riches, therefore, will be used best by the\nman who has the virtue concerned with wealth; and this is the liberal\nman. Now spending and giving seem to be the using of wealth; taking\nand keeping rather the possession of it. Hence it is more the mark of the\nliberal man to give to the right people than to take from the right sources\nand not to take from the wrong. For it is more characteristic of virtue to\ndo good than to have good done to one, and more characteristic to do\nwhat is noble than not to do what is base; and it is not hard to see that\ngiving implies doing good and doing what is noble, and taking implies\nhaving good done to one or not acting basely. And gratitude is felt to-\nwards him who gives, not towards him who does not take, and praise\nalso is bestowed more on him. It is easier, also, not to take than to give;\nfor men are apter to give away their own too little than to take what is\nanother’s. Givers, too, are called liberal; but those who do not take are\nnot praised for liberality but rather for justice; while those who take are\nhardly praised at all. And the liberal are almost the most loved of all\nvirtuous characters, since they are useful; and this depends on their\ngiving.\nNow virtuous actions are noble and done for the sake of the noble.\nTherefore the liberal man, like other virtuous men, will give for the sake\nof the noble, and rightly; for he will give to the right people, the right\namounts, and at the right time, with all the other qualifications that\naccompany right giving; and that too with pleasure or without pain; for\nthat which is virtuous is pleasant or free from pain-least of all will it be\npainful. But he who gives to the wrong people or not for the sake of the\nnoble but for some other cause, will be called not liberal but by some\nother name. Nor is he liberal who gives with pain; for he would prefer\nthe wealth to the noble act, and this is not characteristic of a liberal man.\nBut no more will the liberal man take from wrong sources; for such\ntaking is not characteristic of the man who sets no store by wealth. Nor\nwill he be a ready asker; for it is not characteristic of a man who confers\nbenefits to accept them lightly. But he will take from the right sources,\ne.g., from his own possessions, not as something noble but as a neces-\nsity, that he may have something to give. Nor will he neglect his own\nproperty, since he wishes by means of this to help others. And he will\nrefrain from giving to anybody and everybody, that he may have some-\nthing to give to the right people, at the right time, and where it is noble\nto do so. It is highly characteristic of a liberal man also to go to excess\nin giving, so that he leaves too little for himself; for it is the nature of a\nliberal man not to look to himself. The term ‘liberality’ is used relatively\nto a man’s substance; for liberality resides not in the multitude of the\ngifts but in the state of character of the giver, and this is relative to the\ngiver’s substance. There is therefore nothing to prevent the man who\ngives less from being the more liberal man, if he has less to give those\nare thought to be more liberal who have not made their wealth but inher-\nited it; for in the first place they have no experience of want, and sec-\nondly all men are fonder of their own productions, as are parents and\npoets. It is not easy for the liberal man to be rich, since he is not apt\neither at taking or at keeping, but at giving away, and does not value\nwealth for its own sake but as a means to giving. Hence comes the\ncharge that is brought against fortune, that those who deserve riches\nmost get it least. But it is not unreasonable that it should turn out so; for\nhe cannot have wealth, any more than anything else, if he does not take\npains to have it. Yet he will not give to the wrong people nor at the\nwrong time, and so on; for he would no longer be acting in accordance\nwith liberality, and if he spent on these objects he would have nothing to\nspend on the right objects. For, as has been said, he is liberal who spends\naccording to his substance and on the right objects; and he who exceeds\nis prodigal. Hence we do not call despots prodigal; for it is thought not\neasy for them to give and spend beyond the amount of their possessions.\nLiberality, then, being a mean with regard to giving and taking of wealth,\nthe liberal man will both give and spend the right amounts and on the\nright objects, alike in small things and in great, and that with pleasure;\nhe will also take the right amounts and from the right sources. For, the\nvirtue being a mean with regard to both, he will do both as he ought;\nsince this sort of taking accompanies proper giving, and that which is\nnot of this sort is contrary to it, and accordingly the giving and taking\nthat accompany each other are present together in the same man, while\nthe contrary kinds evidently are not. But if he happens to spend in a\nmanner contrary to what is right and noble, he will be pained, but mod-\nerately and as he ought; for it is the mark of virtue both to be pleased\nand to be pained at the right objects and in the right way. Further, the\nliberal man is easy to deal with in money matters; for he can be got the\nbetter of, since he sets no store by money, and is more annoyed if he has\nnot spent something that he ought than pained if he has spent something\nthat he ought not, and does not agree with the saying of Simonides.\nThe prodigal errs in these respects also; for he is neither pleased nor\npained at the right things or in the right way; this will be more evident as\nwe go on. We have said that prodigality and meanness are excesses and\ndeficiencies, and in two things, in giving and in taking; for we include\nspending under giving. Now prodigality exceeds in giving and not tak-\ning, while meanness falls short in giving, and exceeds in taking, except\nin small things.\nThe characteristics of prodigality are not often combined; for it is\nnot easy to give to all if you take from none; private persons soon ex-\nhaust their substance with giving, and it is to these that the name of\nprodigals is applied—though a man of this sort would seem to be in no\nsmall degree better than a mean man. For he is easily cured both by age\nand by poverty, and thus he may move towards the middle state. For he\nhas the characteristics of the liberal man, since he both gives and re-\nfrains from taking, though he does neither of these in the right manner or\nwell. Therefore if he were brought to do so by habituation or in some\nother way, he would be liberal; for he will then give to the right people,\nand will not take from the wrong sources. This is why he is thought to\nhave not a bad character; it is not the mark of a wicked or ignoble man\nto go to excess in giving and not taking, but only of a foolish one. The\nman who is prodigal in this way is thought much better than the mean\nman both for the aforesaid reasons and because he benefits many while\nthe other benefits no one, not even himself.\nBut most prodigal people, as has been said, also take from the wrong\nsources, and are in this respect mean. They become apt to take because\nthey wish to spend and cannot do this easily; for their possessions soon\nrun short. Thus they are forced to provide means from some other source.\nAt the same time, because they care nothing for honour, they take reck-\nlessly and from any source; for they have an appetite for giving, and\nthey do not mind how or from what source. Hence also their giving is\nnot liberal; for it is not noble, nor does it aim at nobility, nor is it done in\nthe right way; sometimes they make rich those who should be poor, and\nwill give nothing to people of respectable character, and much to flatter-\ners or those who provide them with some other pleasure. Hence also\nmost of them are self-indulgent; for they spend lightly and waste money\non their indulgences, and incline towards pleasures because they do not\nlive with a view to what is noble.\nThe prodigal man, then, turns into what we have described if he is\nleft untutored, but if he is treated with care he will arrive at the interme-\ndiate and right state. But meanness is both incurable (for old age and\nevery disability is thought to make men mean) and more innate in men\nthan prodigality; for most men are fonder of getting money than of giv-\ning. It also extends widely, and is multiform, since there seem to be\nmany kinds of meanness.\nFor it consists in two things, deficiency in giving and excess in\ntaking, and is not found complete in all men but is sometimes divided;\nsome men go to excess in taking, others fall short in giving. Those who\nare called by such names as ‘miserly,’ ‘close,’ ‘stingy,’ all fall short in\ngiving, but do not covet the possessions of others nor wish to get them.\nIn some this is due to a sort of honesty and avoidance of what is dis-\ngraceful (for some seem, or at least profess, to hoard their money for\nthis reason, that they may not some day be forced to do something dis-\ngraceful; to this class belong the cheeseparer and every one of the sort;\nhe is so called from his excess of unwillingness to give anything); while\nothers again keep their hands off the property of others from fear, on the\nground that it is not easy, if one takes the property of others oneself, to\navoid having one’s own taken by them; they are therefore content nei-\nther to take nor to give.\nOthers again exceed in respect of taking by taking anything and\nfrom any source, e.g., those who ply sordid trades, pimps and all such\npeople, and those who lend small sums and at high rates. For all of these\ntake more than they ought and from wrong sources. What is common to\nthem is evidently sordid love of gain; they all put up with a bad name for\nthe sake of gain, and little gain at that. For those who make great gains\nbut from wrong sources, and not the right gains, e.g., despots when they\nsack cities and spoil temples, we do not call mean but rather wicked,\nimpious, and unjust. But the gamester and the footpad (and the high-\nwayman) belong to the class of the mean, since they have a sordid love\nof gain. For it is for gain that both of them ply their craft and endure the\ndisgrace of it, and the one faces the greatest dangers for the sake of the\nbooty, while the other makes gain from his friends, to whom he ought to\nbe giving. Both, then, since they are willing to make gain from wrong\nsources, are sordid lovers of gain; therefore all such forms of taking are\nmean.\nAnd it is natural that meanness is described as the contrary of liber-\nality; for not only is it a greater evil than prodigality, but men err more\noften in this direction than in the way of prodigality as we have de-\nscribed it.\nSo much, then, for liberality and the opposed vices.",

    "text": "It would seem proper to discuss magnificence next. For this also seems\nto be a virtue concerned with wealth; but it does not like liberality ex-\ntend to all the actions that are concerned with wealth, but only to those\nthat involve expenditure; and in these it surpasses liberality in scale.\nFor, as the name itself suggests, it is a fitting expenditure involving\nlargeness of scale. But the scale is relative; for the expense of equipping\na trireme is not the same as that of heading a sacred embassy. It is what\nis fitting, then, in relation to the agent, and to the circumstances and the\nobject. The man who in small or middling things spends according to\nthe merits of the case is not called magnificent (e.g., the man who can\nsay ‘many a gift I gave the wanderer’), but only the man who does so in\ngreat things. For the magnificent man is liberal, but the liberal man is\nnot necessarily magnificent. The deficiency of this state of character is\ncalled niggardliness, the excess vulgarity, lack of taste, and the like,\nwhich do not go to excess in the amount spent on right objects, but by\nshowy expenditure in the wrong circumstances and the wrong manner;\nwe shall speak of these vices later.\nThe magnificent man is like an artist; for he can see what is fitting\nand spend large sums tastefully. For, as we said at the begining, a state\nof character is determined by its activities and by its objects. Now the\nexpenses of the magnificent man are large and fitting. Such, therefore,\nare also his results; for thus there will be a great expenditure and one\nthat is fitting to its result. Therefore the result should be worthy of the\nexpense, and the expense should be worthy of the result, or should even\nexceed it. And the magnificent man will spend such sums for honour’s\nsake; for this is common to the virtues. And further he will do so gladly\nand lavishly; for nice calculation is a niggardly thing. And he will con-\nsider how the result can be made most beautiful and most becoming\nrather than for how much it can be produced and how it can be produced\nmost cheaply. It is necessary, then, that the magnificent man be also\nliberal. For the liberal man also will spend what he ought and as he\nought; and it is in these matters that the greatness implied in the name of\nthe magnificent man-his bigness, as it were-is manifested, since liberal-\nity is concerned with these matters; and at an equal expense he will\nproduce a more magnificent work of art. For a possession and a work of\nart have not the same excellence. The most valuable possession is that\nwhich is worth most, e.g., gold, but the most valuable work of art is that\nwhich is great and beautiful (for the contemplation of such a work in-\nspires admiration, and so does magnificence); and a work has an excel-\nlence-viz. magnificence-which involves magnitude. Magnificence is an\nattribute of expenditures of the kind which we call honourable, e.g.,\nthose connected with the gods—votive offerings, buildings, and sacri-\nfices—and similarly with any form of religious worship, and all those\nthat are proper objects of public-spirited ambition, as when people think\nthey ought to equip a chorus or a trireme, or entertain the city, in a\nbrilliant way. But in all cases, as has been said, we have regard to the\nagent as well and ask who he is and what means he has; for the expen-\nditure should be worthy of his means, and suit not only the result but\nalso the producer. Hence a poor man cannot be magnificent, since he\nhas not the means with which to spend large sums fittingly; and he who\ntries is a fool, since he spends beyond what can be expected of him and\nwhat is proper, but it is right expenditure that is virtuous. But great\nexpenditure is becoming to those who have suitable means to start with,\nacquired by their own efforts or from ancestors or connexions, and to\npeople of high birth or reputation, and so on; for all these things bring\nwith them greatness and prestige. Primarily, then, the magnificent man\nis of this sort, and magnificence is shown in expenditures of this sort, as\nhas been said; for these are the greatest and most honourable. Of private\noccasions of expenditure the most suitable are those that take place\nonce for all, e.g., a wedding or anything of the kind, or anything that\ninterests the whole city or the people of position in it, and also the re-\nceiving of foreign guests and the sending of them on their way, and gifts\nand counter-gifts; for the magnificent man spends not on himself but on\npublic objects, and gifts bear some resemblance to votive offerings. A\nmagnificent man will also furnish his house suitably to his wealth (for\neven a house is a sort of public ornament), and will spend by preference\non those works that are lasting (for these are the most beautiful), and on\nevery class of things he will spend what is becoming; for the same things\nare not suitable for gods and for men, nor in a temple and in a tomb.\nAnd since each expenditure may be great of its kind, and what is most\nmagnificent absolutely is great expenditure on a great object, but what\nis magnificent here is what is great in these circumstances, and great-\nness in the work differs from greatness in the expense (for the most\nbeautiful ball or bottle is magnificent as a gift to a child, but the price of\nit is small and mean),—therefore it is characteristic of the magnificent\nman, whatever kind of result he is producing, to produce it magnifi-\ncently (for such a result is not easily surpassed) and to make it worthy\nof the expenditure.\nSuch, then, is the magnificent man; the man who goes to excess and\nis vulgar exceeds, as has been said, by spending beyond what is right.\nFor on small objects of expenditure he spends much and displays a\ntasteless showiness; e.g., he gives a club dinner on the scale of a wed-\nding banquet, and when he provides the chorus for a comedy he brings\nthem on to the stage in purple, as they do at Megara. And all such things\nhe will do not for honour’s sake but to show off his wealth, and because\nhe thinks he is admired for these things, and where he ought to spend\nmuch he spends little and where little, much. The niggardly man on the\nother hand will fall short in everything, and after spending the greatest\nsums will spoil the beauty of the result for a trifle, and whatever he is\ndoing he will hesitate and consider how he may spend least, and lament\neven that, and think he is doing everything on a bigger scale than he\nought.\nThese states of character, then, are vices; yet they do not bring dis-\ngrace because they are neither harmful to one’s neighbour nor very un-\nseemly.",

    "text": "Pride seems even from its name to be concerned with great things; what\nsort of great things, is the first question we must try to answer. It makes\nno difference whether we consider the state of character or the man\ncharacterized by it. Now the man is thought to be proud who thinks\nhimself worthy of great things, being worthy of them; for he who does\nso beyond his deserts is a fool, but no virtuous man is foolish or silly.\nThe proud man, then, is the man we have described. For he who is\nworthy of little and thinks himself worthy of little is temperate, but not\nproud; for pride implies greatness, as beauty implies a goodsized body,\nand little people may be neat and well-proportioned but cannot be beau-\ntiful. On the other hand, he who thinks himself worthy of great things,\nbeing unworthy of them, is vain; though not every one who thinks him-\nself worthy of more than he really is worthy of in vain. The man who\nthinks himself worthy of worthy of less than he is really worthy of is\nunduly humble, whether his deserts be great or moderate, or his deserts\nbe small but his claims yet smaller. And the man whose deserts are great\nwould seem most unduly humble; for what would he have done if they\nhad been less? The proud man, then, is an extreme in respect of the\ngreatness of his claims, but a mean in respect of the rightness of them;\nfor he claims what is accordance with his merits, while the others go to\nexcess or fall short.\nIf, then, he deserves and claims great things, and above all the great\nthings, he will be concerned with one thing in particular. Desert is rela-\ntive to external goods; and the greatest of these, we should say, is that\nwhich we render to the gods, and which people of position most aim at,\nand which is the prize appointed for the noblest deeds; and this is honour;\nthat is surely the greatest of external goods. Honours and dishonours,\ntherefore, are the objects with respect to which the proud man is as he\nshould be. And even apart from argument it is with honour that proud\nmen appear to be concerned; for it is honour that they chiefly claim, but\nin accordance with their deserts. The unduly humble man falls short\nboth in comparison with his own merits and in comparison with the\nproud man’s claims. The vain man goes to excess in comparison with\nhis own merits, but does not exceed the proud man’s claims.\nNow the proud man, since he deserves most, must be good in the\nhighest degree; for the better man always deserves more, and the best\nman most. Therefore the truly proud man must be good. And greatness\nin every virtue would seem to be characteristic of a proud man. And it\nwould be most unbecoming for a proud man to fly from danger, swing-\ning his arms by his sides, or to wrong another; for to what end should he\ndo disgraceful acts, he to whom nothing is great? If we consider him\npoint by point we shall see the utter absurdity of a proud man who is not\ngood. Nor, again, would he be worthy of honour if he were bad; for\nhonour is the prize of virtue, and it is to the good that it is rendered.\nPride, then, seems to be a sort of crown of the virtues; for it makes them\ngreater, and it is not found without them. Therefore it is hard to be truly\nproud; for it is impossible without nobility and goodness of character. It\nis chiefly with honours and dishonours, then, that the proud man is con-\ncerned; and at honours that are great and conferred by good men he will\nbe moderately Pleased, thinking that he is coming by his own or even\nless than his own; for there can be no honour that is worthy of perfect\nvirtue, yet he will at any rate accept it since they have nothing greater to\nbestow on him; but honour from casual people and on trifling grounds\nhe will utterly despise, since it is not this that he deserves, and dishonour\ntoo, since in his case it cannot be just. In the first place, then, as has\nbeen said, the proud man is concerned with honours; yet he will also\nbear himself with moderation towards wealth and power and all good or\nevil fortune, whatever may befall him, and will be neither over-joyed by\ngood fortune nor over-pained by evil. For not even towards honour does\nhe bear himself as if it were a very great thing. Power and wealth are\ndesirable for the sake of honour (at least those who have them wish to\nget honour by means of them); and for him to whom even honour is a\nlittle thing the others must be so too. Hence proud men are thought to be\ndisdainful.\nThe goods of fortune also are thought to contribute towards pride.\nFor men who are well-born are thought worthy of honour, and so are\nthose who enjoy power or wealth; for they are in a superior position,\nand everything that has a superiority in something good is held in greater\nhonour. Hence even such things make men prouder; for they are honoured\nby some for having them; but in truth the good man alone is to be\nhonoured; he, however, who has both advantages is thought the more\nworthy of honour. But those who without virtue have such goods are\nneither justified in making great claims nor entitled to the name of ‘proud’;\nfor these things imply perfect virtue. Disdainful and insolent, however,\neven those who have such goods become. For without virtue it is not\neasy to bear gracefully the goods of fortune; and, being unable to bear\nthem, and thinking themselves superior to others, they despise others\nand themselves do what they please. They imitate the proud man with-\nout being like him, and this they do where they can; so they do not act\nvirtuously, but they do despise others. For the proud man despises justly\n(since he thinks truly), but the many do so at random.\nHe does not run into trifling dangers, nor is he fond of danger, be-\ncause he honours few things; but he will face great dangers, and when\nhe is in danger he is unsparing of his life, knowing that there are condi-\ntions on which life is not worth having. And he is the sort of man to\nconfer benefits, but he is ashamed of receiving them; for the one is the\nmark of a superior, the other of an inferior. And he is apt to confer\ngreater benefits in return; for thus the original benefactor besides being\npaid will incur a debt to him, and will be the gainer by the transaction.\nThey seem also to remember any service they have done, but not those\nthey have received (for he who receives a service is inferior to him who\nhas done it, but the proud man wishes to be superior), and to hear of the\nformer with pleasure, of the latter with displeasure; this, it seems, is\nwhy Thetis did not mention to Zeus the services she had done him, and\nwhy the Spartans did not recount their services to the Athenians, but\nthose they had received. It is a mark of the proud man also to ask for\nnothing or scarcely anything, but to give help readily, and to be digni-\nfied towards people who enjoy high position and good fortune, but un-\nassuming towards those of the middle class; for it is a difficult and lofty\nthing to be superior to the former, but easy to be so to the latter, and a\nlofty bearing over the former is no mark of ill-breeding, but among\nhumble people it is as vulgar as a display of strength against the weak.\nAgain, it is characteristic of the proud man not to aim at the things\ncommonly held in honour, or the things in which others excel; to be\nsluggish and to hold back except where great honour or a great work is\nat stake, and to be a man of few deeds, but of great and notable ones. He\nmust also be open in his hate and in his love (for to conceal one’s feel-\nings, i.e., to care less for truth than for what people will think, is a\ncoward’s part), and must speak and act openly; for he is free of speech\nbecause he is contemptuous, and he is given to telling the truth, except\nwhen he speaks in irony to the vulgar. He must be unable to make his\nlife revolve round another, unless it be a friend; for this is slavish, and\nfor this reason all flatterers are servile and people lacking in self-respect\nare flatterers. Nor is he given to admiration; for nothing to him is great.\nNor is he mindful of wrongs; for it is not the part of a proud man to have\na long memory, especially for wrongs, but rather to overlook them. Nor\nis he a gossip; for he will speak neither about himself nor about another,\nsince he cares not to be praised nor for others to be blamed; nor again is\nhe given to praise; and for the same reason he is not an evil-speaker,\neven about his enemies, except from haughtiness. With regard to neces-\nsary or small matters he is least of all me given to lamentation or the\nasking of favours; for it is the part of one who takes such matters seri-\nously to behave so with respect to them. He is one who will possess\nbeautiful and profitless things rather than profitable and useful ones;\nfor this is more proper to a character that suffices to itself.\nFurther, a slow step is thought proper to the proud man, a deep\nvoice, and a level utterance; for the man who takes few things seriously\nis not likely to be hurried, nor the man who thinks nothing great to be\nexcited, while a shrill voice and a rapid gait are the results of hurry and\nexcitement.\nSuch, then, is the proud man; the man who falls short of him is\nunduly humble, and the man who goes beyond him is vain. Now even\nthese are not thought to be bad (for they are not malicious), but only\nmistaken. For the unduly humble man, being worthy of good things,\nrobs himself of what he deserves, and to have something bad about him\nfrom the fact that he does not think himself worthy of good things, and\nseems also not to know himself; else he would have desired the things he\nwas worthy of, since these were good. Yet such people are not thought\nto be fools, but rather unduly retiring. Such a reputation, however, seems\nactually to make them worse; for each class of people aims at what\ncorresponds to its worth, and these people stand back even from noble\nactions and undertakings, deeming themselves unworthy, and from ex-\nternal goods no less. Vain people, on the other hand, are fools and igno-\nrant of themselves, and that manifestly; for, not being worthy of them,\nthey attempt honourable undertakings, and then are found out; and they\nadorn themselves with clothing and outward show and such things, and\nwish their strokes of good fortune to be made public, and speak about\nthem as if they would be honoured for them. But undue humility is more\nopposed to pride than vanity is; for it is both commoner and worse.\nPride, then, is concerned with honour on the grand scale, as has\nbeen said.",

    "text": "There seems to be in the sphere of honour also, as was said in our first\nremarks on the subject, a virtue which would appear to be related to\npride as liberality is to magnificence. For neither of these has anything\nto do with the grand scale, but both dispose us as is right with regard to\nmiddling and unimportant objects; as in getting and giving of wealth\nthere is a mean and an excess and defect, so too honour may be desired\nmore than is right, or less, or from the right sources and in the right way.\nWe blame both the ambitious man as am at honour more than is right\nand from wrong sources, and the unambitious man as not willing to be\nhonoured even for noble reasons. But sometimes we praise the ambi-\ntious man as being manly and a lover of what is noble, and the unambi-\ntious man as being moderate and self-controlled, as we said in our first\ntreatment of the subject. Evidently, since ‘fond of such and such an\nobject’ has more than one meaning, we do not assign the term ‘ambi-\ntion’ or ‘love of honour’ always to the same thing, but when we praise\nthe quality we think of the man who loves honour more than most people,\nand when we blame it we think of him who loves it more than is right.\nThe mean being without a name, the extremes seem to dispute for its\nplace as though that were vacant by default. But where there is excess\nand defect, there is also an intermediate; now men desire honour both\nmore than they should and less; therefore it is possible also to do so as\none should; at all events this is the state of character that is praised,\nbeing an unnamed mean in respect of honour. Relatively to ambition it\nseems to be unambitiousness, and relatively to unambitiousness it seems\nto be ambition, while relatively to both severally it seems in a sense to\nbe both together. This appears to be true of the other virtues also. But in\nthis case the extremes seem to be contradictories because the mean has\nnot received a name.",

    "text": "Good temper is a mean with respect to anger; the middle state being\nunnamed, and the extremes almost without a name as well, we place\ngood temper in the middle position, though it inclines towards the defi-\nciency, which is without a name. The excess might called a sort of ‘iras-\ncibility.’ For the passion is anger, while its causes are many and diverse.\nThe man who is angry at the right things and with the right people,\nand, further, as he ought, when he ought, and as long as he ought, is\npraised. This will be the good-tempered man, then, since good temper is\npraised. For the good-tempered man tends to be unperturbed and not to\nbe led by passion, but to be angry in the manner, at the things, and for\nthe length of time, that the rule dictates; but he is thought to err rather in\nthe direction of deficiency; for the good-tempered man is not revenge-\nful, but rather tends to make allowances.\nThe deficiency, whether it is a sort of ‘inirascibility’ or whatever it\nis, is blamed. For those who are not angry at the things they should be\nangry at are thought to be fools, and so are those who are not angry in\nthe right way, at the right time, or with the right persons; for such a man\nis thought not to feel things nor to be pained by them, and, since he does\nnot get angry, he is thought unlikely to defend himself; and to endure\nbeing insulted and put up with insult to one’s friends is slavish.\nThe excess can be manifested in all the points that have been named\n(for one can be angry with the wrong persons, at the wrong things, more\nthan is right, too quickly, or too long); yet all are not found in the same\nperson. Indeed they could not; for evil destroys even itself, and if it is\ncomplete becomes unbearable. Now hot-tempered people get angry\nquickly and with the wrong persons and at the wrong things and more\nthan is right, but their anger ceases quickly-which is the best point about\nthem. This happens to them because they do not restrain their anger but\nretaliate openly owing to their quickness of temper, and then their anger\nceases. By reason of excess choleric people are quick-tempered and\nready to be angry with everything and on every occasion; whence their\nname. Sulky people are hard to appease, and retain their anger long; for\nthey repress their passion. But it ceases when they retaliate; for revenge\nrelieves them of their anger, producing in them pleasure instead of pain.\nIf this does not happen they retain their burden; for owing to its not\nbeing obvious no one even reasons with them, and to digest one’s anger\nin oneself takes time. Such people are most troublesome to themselves\nand to their dearest friends. We call had-tempered those who are angry\nat the wrong things, more than is right, and longer, and cannot be ap-\npeased until they inflict vengeance or punishment.\nTo good temper we oppose the excess rather than the defect; for not\nonly is it commoner since revenge is the more human), but bad-tem-\npered people are worse to live with.\nWhat we have said in our earlier treatment of the subject is plain\nalso from what we are now saying; viz., that it is not easy to define how,\nwith whom, at what, and how long one should be angry, and at what\npoint right action ceases and wrong begins. For the man who strays a\nlittle from the path, either towards the more or towards the less, is not\nblamed; since sometimes we praise those who exhibit the deficiency,\nand call them good-tempered, and sometimes we call angry people manly,\nas being capable of ruling. How far, therefore, and how a man must\nstray before he becomes blameworthy, it is not easy to state in words;\nfor the decision depends on the particular facts and on perception. But\nso much at least is plain, that the middle state is praiseworthy—that in\nvirtue of which we are angry with the right people, at the right things, in\nthe right way, and so on, while the excesses and defects are blamewor-\nthy—slightly so if they are present in a low degree, more if in a higher\ndegree, and very much if in a high degree. Evidently, then, we must\ncling to the middle state.—Enough of the states relative to anger.",

    "text": "In gatherings of men, in social life and the interchange of words and\ndeeds, some men are thought to be obsequious, viz. those who to give\npleasure praise everything and never oppose, but think it their duty ‘to\ngive no pain to the people they meet’; while those who, on the contrary,\noppose everything and care not a whit about giving pain are called churl-\nish and contentious. That the states we have named are culpable is plain\nenough, and that the middle state is laudable—that in virtue of which a\nman will put up with, and will resent, the right things and in the right\nway; but no name has been assigned to it, though it most resembles\nfriendship. For the man who corresponds to this middle state is very\nmuch what, with affection added, we call a good friend. But the state in\nquestion differs from friendship in that it implies no passion or affection\nfor one’s associates; since it is not by reason of loving or hating that\nsuch a man takes everything in the right way, but by being a man of a\ncertain kind. For he will behave so alike towards those he knows and\nthose he does not know, towards intimates and those who are not so,\nexcept that in each of these cases he will behave as is befitting; for it is\nnot proper to have the same care for intimates and for strangers, nor\nagain is it the same conditions that make it right to give pain to them.\nNow we have said generally that he will associate with people in the\nright way; but it is by reference to what is honourable and expedient that\nhe will aim at not giving pain or at contributing pleasure. For he seems\nto be concerned with the pleasures and pains of social life; and wherever\nit is not honourable, or is harmful, for him to contribute pleasure, he\nwill refuse, and will choose rather to give pain; also if his acquiescence\nin another’s action would bring disgrace, and that in a high degree, or\ninjury, on that other, while his opposition brings a little pain, he will not\nacquiesce but will decline. He will associate differently with people in\nhigh station and with ordinary people, with closer and more distant ac-\nquaintances, and so too with regard to all other differences, rendering to\neach class what is befitting, and while for its own sake he chooses to\ncontribute pleasure, and avoids the giving of pain, he will be guided by\nthe consequences, if these are greater, i.e., honour and expediency. For\nthe sake of a great future pleasure, too, he will inflict small pains.\nThe man who attains the mean, then, is such as we have described,\nbut has not received a name; of those who contribute pleasure, the man\nwho aims at being pleasant with no ulterior object is obsequious, but the\nman who does so in order that he may get some advantage in the direc-\ntion of money or the things that money buys is a flatterer; while the man\nwho quarrels with everything is, as has been said, churlish and conten-\ntious. And the extremes seem to be contradictory to each other because\nthe mean is without a name.",

    "text": "The mean opposed to boastfulness is found in almost the same sphere;\nand this also is without a name. It will be no bad plan to describe these\nstates as well; for we shall both know the facts about character better if\nwe go through them in detail, and we shall be convinced that the virtues\nare means if we see this to be so in all cases. In the field of social life\nthose who make the giving of pleasure or pain their object in associating\nwith others have been described; let us now describe those who pursue\ntruth or falsehood alike in words and deeds and in the claims they put\nforward. The boastful man, then, is thought to be apt to claim the things\nthat bring glory, when he has not got them, or to claim more of them\nthan he has, and the mock-modest man on the other hand to disclaim\nwhat he has or belittle it, while the man who observes the mean is one\nwho calls a thing by its own name, being truthful both in life and in\nword, owning to what he has, and neither more nor less. Now each of\nthese courses may be adopted either with or without an object. But each\nman speaks and acts and lives in accordance with his character, if he is\nnot acting for some ulterior object. And falsehood is in itself mean and\nculpable, and truth noble and worthy of praise. Thus the truthful man is\nanother case of a man who, being in the mean, is worthy of praise, and\nboth forms of untruthful man are culpable, and particularly the boastful\nman.\nLet us discuss them both, but first of all the truthful man. We are\nnot speaking of the man who keeps faith in his agreements, i.e., in the\nthings that pertain to justice or injustice (for this would belong to an-\nother virtue), but the man who in the matters in which nothing of this\nsort is at stake is true both in word and in life because his character is\nsuch. But such a man would seem to be as a matter of fact equitable.\nFor the man who loves truth, and is truthful where nothing is at stake,\nwill still more be truthful where something is at stake; he will avoid\nfalsehood as something base, seeing that he avoided it even for its own\nsake; and such a man is worthy of praise. He inclines rather to under-\nstate the truth; for this seems in better taste because exaggerations are\nwearisome.\nHe who claims more than he has with no ulterior object is a con-\ntemptible sort of fellow (otherwise he would not have delighted in false-\nhood), but seems futile rather than bad; but if he does it for an object, he\nwho does it for the sake of reputation or honour is (for a boaster) not\nvery much to be blamed, but he who does it for money, or the things that\nlead to money, is an uglier character (it is not the capacity that makes\nthe boaster, but the purpose; for it is in virtue of his state of character\nand by being a man of a certain kind that he is boaster); as one man is a\nliar because he enjoys the lie itself, and another because he desires repu-\ntation or gain. Now those who boast for the sake of reputation claim\nsuch qualities as will praise or congratulation, but those whose object is\ngain claim qualities which are of value to one’s neighbours and one’s\nlack of which is not easily detected, e.g., the powers of a seer, a sage, or\na physician. For this reason it is such things as these that most people\nclaim and boast about; for in them the above-mentioned qualities are\nfound.\nMock-modest people, who understate things, seem more attractive\nin character; for they are thought to speak not for gain but to avoid\nparade; and here too it is qualities which bring reputation that they dis-\nclaim, as Socrates used to do. Those who disclaim trifling and obvious\nqualities are called humbugs and are more contemptible; and sometimes\nthis seems to be boastfulness, like the Spartan dress; for both excess and\ngreat deficiency are boastful. But those who use understatement with\nmoderation and understate about matters that do not very much force\nthemselves on our notice seem attractive. And it is the boaster that seems\nto be opposed to the truthful man; for he is the worse character.",

    "text": "Since life includes rest as well as activity, and in this is included leisure\nand amusement, there seems here also to be a kind of intercourse which\nis tasteful; there is such a thing as saying—and again listening to—\nwhat one should and as one should. The kind of people one is speaking\nor listening to will also make a difference. Evidently here also there is\nboth an excess and a deficiency as compared with the mean. Those who\ncarry humour to excess are thought to be vulgar buffoons, striving after\nhumour at all costs, and aiming rather at raising a laugh than at saying\nwhat is becoming and at avoiding pain to the object of their fun; while\nthose who can neither make a joke themselves nor put up with those\nwho do are thought to be boorish and unpolished. But those who joke in\na tasteful way are called ready-witted, which implies a sort of readiness\nto turn this way and that; for such sallies are thought to be movements\nof the character, and as bodies are discriminated by their movements, so\ntoo are characters. The ridiculous side of things is not far to seek, how-\never, and most people delight more than they should in amusement and\nin jestinly. and so even buffoons are called ready-witted because they\nare found attractive; but that they differ from the ready-witted man, and\nto no small extent, is clear from what has been said.\nTo the middle state belongs also tact; it is the mark of a tactful man\nto say and listen to such things as befit a good and well-bred man; for\nthere are some things that it befits such a man to say and to hear by way\nof jest, and the well-bred man’s jesting differs from that of a vulgar\nman, and the joking of an educated man from that of an uneducated.\nOne may see this even from the old and the new comedies; to the authors\nof the former indecency of language was amusing, to those of the latter\ninnuendo is more so; and these differ in no small degree in respect of\npropriety. Now should we define the man who jokes well by his saying\nwhat is not unbecoming to a well-bred man, or by his not giving pain, or\neven giving delight, to the hearer? Or is the latter definition, at any rate,\nitself indefinite, since different things are hateful or pleasant to different\npeople? The kind of jokes he will listen to will be the same; for the kind\nhe can put up with are also the kind he seems to make. There are, then,\njokes he will not make; for the jest is a sort of abuse, and there are things\nthat lawgivers forbid us to abuse; and they should, perhaps, have for-\nbidden us even to make a jest of such. The refined and well-bred man,\ntherefore, will be as we have described, being as it were a law to him-\nself.\nSuch, then, is the man who observes the mean, whether he be called\ntactful or ready-witted. The buffoon, on the other hand, is the slave of\nhis sense of humour, and spares neither himself nor others if he can raise\na laugh, and says things none of which a man of refinement would say,\nand to some of which he would not even listen. The boor, again, is\nuseless for such social intercourse; for he contributes nothing and finds\nfault with everything. But relaxation and amusement are thought to be a\nnecessary element in life.\nThe means in life that have been described, then, are three in num-\nber, and are all concerned with an interchange of words and deeds of\nsome kind. They differ, however, in that one is concerned with truth;\nand the other two with pleasantness. Of those concerned with pleasure,\none is displayed in jests, the other in the general social intercourse of\nlife.",

    "text": "Shame should not be described as a virtue; for it is more like a feeling\nthan a state of character. It is defined, at any rate, as a kind of fear of\ndishonour, and produces an effect similar to that produced by fear of\ndanger; for people who feel disgraced blush, and those who fear death\nturn pale. Both, therefore, seem to be in a sense bodily conditions, which\nis thought to be characteristic of feeling rather than of a state of charac-\nter.\nThe feeling is not becoming to every age, but only to youth. For we\nthink young people should be prone to the feeling of shame because they\nlive by feeling and therefore commit many errors, but are restrained by\nshame; and we praise young people who are prone to this feeling, but an\nolder person no one would praise for being prone to the sense of dis-\ngrace, since we think he should not do anything that need cause this\nsense. For the sense of disgrace is not even characteristic of a good man,\nsince it is consequent on bad actions (for such actions should not be\ndone; and if some actions are disgraceful in very truth and others only\naccording to common opinion, this makes no difference; for neither class\nof actions should be done, so that no disgrace should be felt); and it is a\nmark of a bad man even to be such as to do any disgraceful action. To\nbe so constituted as to feel disgraced if one does such an action, and for\nthis reason to think oneself good, is absurd; for it is for voluntary ac-\ntions that shame is felt, and the good man will never voluntarily do bad\nactions. But shame may be said to be conditionally a good thing; if a\ngood man does such actions, he will feel disgraced; but the virtues are\nnot subject to such a qualification. And if shamelessness—not to be\nashamed of doing base actions—is bad, that does not make it good to be\nashamed of doing such actions. Continence too is not virtue, but a mixed\nsort of state; this will be shown later. Now, however, let us discuss\njustice.",

    "text": "With regards to justice and injustice we must (1) consider what kind of\nactions they are concerned with, (2) what sort of mean justice is, and (3)\nbetween what extremes the just act is intermediate. Our investigation\nshall follow the same course as the preceding discussions.\nWe see that all men mean by justice that kind of state of character\nwhich makes people disposed to do what is just and makes them act\njustly and wish for what is just; and similarly by injustice that state\nwhich makes them act unjustly and wish for what is unjust. Let us too,\nthen, lay this down as a general basis. For the same is not true of the\nsciences and the faculties as of states of character. A faculty or a sci-\nence which is one and the same is held to relate to contrary objects, but\na state of character which is one of two contraries does not produce the\ncontrary results; e.g., as a result of health we do not do what is the\nopposite of healthy, but only what is healthy; for we say a man walks\nhealthily, when he walks as a healthy man would.\nNow often one contrary state is recognized from its contrary, and\noften states are recognized from the subjects that exhibit them; for (A) if\ngood condition is known, bad condition also becomes known, and (B)\ngood condition is known from the things that are in good condition, and\nthey from it. If good condition is firmness of flesh, it is necessary both\nthat bad condition should be flabbiness of flesh and that the wholesome\nshould be that which causes firmness in flesh. And it follows for the\nmost part that if one contrary is ambiguous the other also will be am-\nbiguous; e.g., if ‘just’ is so, that ‘unjust’ will be so too.\nNow ‘justice’ and ‘injustice’ seem to be ambiguous, but because\ntheir different meanings approach near to one another the ambiguity\nescapes notice and is not obvious as it is, comparatively, when the mean-\nings are far apart, e.g., (for here the difference in outward form is great)\nas the ambiguity in the use of kleis for the collar-bone of an animal and\nfor that with which we lock a door. Let us take as a starting-point, then,\nthe various meanings of ‘an unjust man.’ Both the lawless man and the\ngrasping and unfair man are thought to be unjust, so that evidently both\nthe law-abiding and the fair man will be just. The just, then, is the law-\nful and the fair, the unjust the unlawful and the unfair.\nSince the unjust man is grasping, he must be concerned with goods-\nnot all goods, but those with which prosperity and adversity have to do,\nwhich taken absolutely are always good, but for a particular person are\nnot always good. Now men pray for and pursue these things; but they\nshould not, but should pray that the things that are good absolutely may\nalso be good for them, and should choose the things that are good for\nthem. The unjust man does not always choose the greater, but also the\nless—in the case of things bad absolutely; but because the lesser evil is\nitself thought to be in a sense good, and graspingness is directed at the\ngood, therefore he is thought to be grasping. And he is unfair; for this\ncontains and is common to both.\nSince the lawless man was seen to be unjust and the law-abiding\nman just, evidently all lawful acts are in a sense just acts; for the acts\nlaid down by the legislative art are lawful, and each of these, we say, is\njust. Now the laws in their enactments on all subjects aim at the com-\nmon advantage either of all or of the best or of those who hold power, or\nsomething of the sort; so that in one sense we call those acts just that\ntend to produce and preserve happiness and its components for the po-\nlitical society. And the law bids us do both the acts of a brave man (e.g.,\nnot to desert our post nor take to flight nor throw away our arms), and\nthose of a temperate man (e.g., not to commit adultery nor to gratify\none’s lust), and those of a good-tempered man (e.g., not to strike an-\nother nor to speak evil), and similarly with regard to the other virtues\nand forms of wickedness, commanding some acts and forbidding oth-\ners; and the rightly-framed law does this rightly, and the hastily con-\nceived one less well. This form of justice, then, is complete virtue, but\nnot absolutely, but in relation to our neighbour. And therefore justice is\noften thought to be the greatest of virtues, and ‘neither evening nor morn-\ning star’ is so wonderful; and proverbially ‘in justice is every virtue\ncomprehended’. And it is complete virtue in its fullest sense, because it\nis the actual exercise of complete virtue. It is complete because he who\npossesses it can exercise his virtue not only in himself but towards his\nneighbour also; for many men can exercise virtue in their own affairs,\nbut not in their relations to their neighbour. This is why the saying of\nBias is thought to be true, that ‘rule will show the man’; for a ruler is\nnecessarily in relation to other men and a member of a society. For this\nsame reason justice, alone of the virtues, is thought to be ‘another’s\ngood,’ because it is related to our neighbour; for it does what is advan-\ntageous to another, either a ruler or a copartner. Now the worst man is\nhe who exercises his wickedness both towards himself and towards his\nfriends, and the best man is not he who exercises his virtue towards\nhimself but he who exercises it towards another; for this is a difficult\ntask. Justice in this sense, then, is not part of virtue but virtue entire, nor\nis the contrary injustice a part of vice but vice entire. What the differ-\nence is between virtue and justice in this sense is plain from what we\nhave said; they are the same but their essence is not the same; what, as\na relation to one’s neighbour, is justice is, as a certain kind of state\nwithout qualification, virtue.",

    "text": "But at all events what we are investigating is the justice which is a part\nof virtue; for there is a justice of this kind, as we maintain. Similarly it\nis with injustice in the particular sense that we are concerned.\nThat there is such a thing is indicated by the fact that while the man\nwho exhibits in action the other forms of wickedness acts wrongly in-\ndeed, but not graspingly (e.g., the man who throws away his shield\nthrough cowardice or speaks harshly through bad temper or fails to help\na friend with money through meanness), when a man acts graspingly he\noften exhibits none of these vices,-no, nor all together, but certainly\nwickedness of some kind (for we blame him) and injustice. There is,\nthen, another kind of injustice which is a part of injustice in the wide\nsense, and a use of the word ‘unjust’ which answers to a part of what is\nunjust in the wide sense of ‘contrary to the law’. Again if one man\ncommits adultery for the sake of gain and makes money by it, while\nanother does so at the bidding of appetite though he loses money and is\npenalized for it, the latter would be held to be self-indulgent rather than\ngrasping, but the former is unjust, but not self-indulgent; evidently, there-\nfore, he is unjust by reason of his making gain by his act. Again, all\nother unjust acts are ascribed invariably to some particular kind of wick-\nedness, e.g., adultery to self-indulgence, the desertion of a comrade in\nbattle to cowardice, physical violence to anger; but if a man makes gain,\nhis action is ascribed to no form of wickedness but injustice. Evidently,\ntherefore, there is apart from injustice in the wide sense another, ‘par-\nticular,’ injustice which shares the name and nature of the first, because\nits definition falls within the same genus; for the significance of both\nconsists in a relation to one’s neighbour, but the one is concerned with\nhonour or money or safety—or that which includes all these, if we had\na single name for it—and its motive is the pleasure that arises from\ngain; while the other is concerned with all the objects with which the\ngood man is concerned.\nIt is clear, then, that there is more than one kind of justice, and that\nthere is one which is distinct from virtue entire; we must try to grasp its\ngenus and differentia.\nThe unjust has been divided into the unlawful and the unfair, and\nthe just into the lawful and the fair. To the unlawful answers the afore-\nmentioned sense of injustice. But since unfair and the unlawful are not\nthe same, but are different as a part is from its whole (for all that is\nunfair is unlawful, but not all that is unlawful is unfair), the unjust and\ninjustice in the sense of the unfair are not the same as but different from\nthe former kind, as part from whole; for injustice in this sense is a part\nof injustice in the wide sense, and similarly justice in the one sense of\njustice in the other. Therefore we must speak also about particular jus-\ntice and particular and similarly about the just and the unjust. The jus-\ntice, then, which answers to the whole of virtue, and the corresponding\ninjustice, one being the exercise of virtue as a whole, and the other that\nof vice as a whole, towards one’s neighbour, we may leave on one side.\nAnd how the meanings of ‘just’ and ‘unjust’ which answer to these are\nto be distinguished is evident; for practically the majority of the acts\ncommanded by the law are those which are prescribed from the point of\nview of virtue taken as a whole; for the law bids us practise every virtue\nand forbids us to practise any vice. And the things that tend to produce\nvirtue taken as a whole are those of the acts prescribed by the law which\nhave been prescribed with a view to education for the common good.\nBut with regard to the education of the individual as such, which makes\nhim without qualification a good man, we must determine later whether\nthis is the function of the political art or of another; for perhaps it is not\nthe same to be a good man and a good citizen of any state taken at\nrandom.\nOf particular justice and that which is just in the corresponding\nsense, (A) one kind is that which is manifested in distributions of honour\nor money or the other things that fall to be divided among those who\nhave a share in the constitution (for in these it is possible for one man to\nhave a share either unequal or equal to that of another), and (B) one is\nthat which plays a rectifying part in transactions between man and man.\nOf this there are two divisions; of transactions (1) some are voluntary\nand (2) others involuntary—voluntary such transactions as sale, pur-\nchase, loan for consumption, pledging, loan for use, depositing, letting\n(they are called voluntary because the origin of these transactions is\nvoluntary), while of the involuntary (a) some are clandestine, such as\ntheft, adultery, poisoning, procuring, enticement of slaves, assassina-\ntion, false witness, and (b) others are violent, such as assault, imprison-\nment, murder, robbery with violence, mutilation, abuse, insult.",

    "text": "(A) We have shown that both the unjust man and the unjust act are\nunfair or unequal; now it is clear that there is also an intermediate be-\ntween the two unequals involved in either case. And this is the equal; for\nin any kind of action in which there’s a more and a less there is also\nwhat is equal. If, then, the unjust is unequal, just is equal, as all men\nsuppose it to be, even apart from argument. And since the equal is inter-\nmediate, the just will be an intermediate. Now equality implies at least\ntwo things. The just, then, must be both intermediate and equal and\nrelative (i.e., for certain persons). And since the equall intermediate it\nmust be between certain things (which are respectively greater and less);\nequal, it involves two things; qua just, it is for certain people. The just,\ntherefore, involves at least four terms; for the persons for whom it is in\nfact just are two, and the things in which it is manifested, the objects\ndistributed, are two. And the same equality will exist between the per-\nsons and between the things concerned; for as the latter the things con-\ncerned—are related, so are the former; if they are not equal, they will\nnot have what is equal, but this is the origin of quarrels and complaints—\nwhen either equals have and are awarded unequal shares, or unequals\nequal shares. Further, this is plain from the fact that awards should be\n‘according to merit’; for all men agree that what is just in distribution\nmust be according to merit in some sense, though they do not all specify\nthe same sort of merit, but democrats identify it with the status of free-\nman, supporters of oligarchy with wealth (or with noble birth), and sup-\nporters of aristocracy with excellence.\nThe just, then, is a species of the proportionate (proportion being\nnot a property only of the kind of number which consists of abstract\nunits, but of number in general). For proportion is equality of ratios,\nand involves four terms at least (that discrete proportion involves four\nterms is plain, but so does continuous proportion, for it uses one term as\ntwo and mentions it twice; e.g., ‘as the line A is to the line B, so is the\nline B to the line C’; the line B, then, has been mentioned twice, so that\nif the line B be assumed twice, the proportional terms will be four); and\nthe just, too, involves at least four terms, and the ratio between one pair\nis the same as that between the other pair; for there is a similar distinc-\ntion between the persons and between the things. As the term A, then, is\nto B, so will C be to D, and therefore, alternando, as A is to C, B will be\nto D. Therefore also the whole is in the same ratio to the whole; and this\ncoupling the distribution effects, and, if the terms are so combined, ef-\nfects justly. The conjunction, then, of the term A with C and of B with D\nis what is just in distribution, and this species of the just is intermediate,\nand the unjust is what violates the proportion; for the proportional is\nintermediate, and the just is proportional. (Mathematicians call this kind\nof proportion geometrical; for it is in geometrical proportion that it fol-\nlows that the whole is to the whole as either part is to the corresponding\npart.) This proportion is not continuous; for we cannot get a single term\nstanding for a person and a thing.\nThis, then, is what the just is—the proportional; the unjust is what\nviolates the proportion. Hence one term becomes too great, the other too\nsmall, as indeed happens in practice; for the man who acts unjustly has\ntoo much, and the man who is unjustly treated too little, of what is good.\nIn the case of evil the reverse is true; for the lesser evil is reckoned a\ngood in comparison with the greater evil, since the lesser evil is rather to\nbe chosen than the greater, and what is worthy of choice is good, and\nwhat is worthier of choice a greater good.\nThis, then, is one species of the just.",

    "text": "(B) The remaining one is the rectificatory, which arises in connexion\nwith transactions both voluntary and involuntary. This form of the just\nhas a different specific character from the former. For the justice which\ndistributes common possessions is always in accordance with the kind\nof proportion mentioned above (for in the case also in which the distri-\nbution is made from the common funds of a partnership it will be ac-\ncording to the same ratio which the funds put into the business by the\npartners bear to one another); and the injustice opposed to this kind of\njustice is that which violates the proportion. But the justice in transac-\ntions between man and man is a sort of equality indeed, and the injustice\na sort of inequality; not according to that kind of proportion, however,\nbut according to arithmetical proportion. For it makes no difference\nwhether a good man has defrauded a bad man or a bad man a good one,\nnor whether it is a good or a bad man that has committed adultery; the\nlaw looks only to the distinctive character of the injury, and treats the\nparties as equal, if one is in the wrong and the other is being wronged,\nand if one inflicted injury and the other has received it. Therefore, this\nkind of injustice being an inequality, the judge tries to equalize it; for in\nthe case also in which one has received and the other has inflicted a\nwound, or one has slain and the other been slain, the suffering and the\naction have been unequally distributed; but the judge tries to equalize by\nmeans of the penalty, taking away from the gain of the assailant. For the\nterm ‘gain’ is applied generally to such cases, even if it be not a term\nappropriate to certain cases, e.g., to the person who inflicts a woundand\n‘loss’ to the sufferer; at all events when the suffering has been esti-\nmated, the one is called loss and the other gain. Therefore the equal is\nintermediate between the greater and the less, but the gain and the loss\nare respectively greater and less in contrary ways; more of the good and\nless of the evil are gain, and the contrary is loss; intermediate between\nthem is, as we saw, equal, which we say is just; therefore corrective\njustice will be the intermediate between loss and gain. This is why, when\npeople dispute, they take refuge in the judge; and to go to the judge is to\ngo to justice; for the nature of the judge is to be a sort of animate justice;\nand they seek the judge as an intermediate, and in some states they call\njudges mediators, on the assumption that if they get what is intermediate\nthey will get what is just. The just, then, is an intermediate, since the\njudge is so. Now the judge restores equality; it is as though there were a\nline divided into unequal parts, and he took away that by which the\ngreater segment exceeds the half, and added it to the smaller segment.\nAnd when the whole has been equally divided, then they say they have\n‘their own’-i.e., when they have got what is equal. The equal is interme-\ndiate between the greater and the lesser line according to arithmetical\nproportion. It is for this reason also that it is called just (sikaion), be-\ncause it is a division into two equal parts (sicha), just as if one were to\ncall it sichaion; and the judge (sikastes) is one who bisects (sichastes).\nFor when something is subtracted from one of two equals and added to\nthe other, the other is in excess by these two; since if what was taken\nfrom the one had not been added to the other, the latter would have been\nin excess by one only. It therefore exceeds the intermediate by one, and\nthe intermediate exceeds by one that from which something was taken.\nBy this, then, we shall recognize both what we must subtract from that\nwhich has more, and what we must add to that which has less; we must\nadd to the latter that by which the intermediate exceeds it, and subtract\nfrom the greatest that by which it exceeds the intermediate. Let the lines\nAA,’ BB,’ CC’ be equal to one another; from the line AA’ let the seg-\nment AE have been subtracted, and to the line CC’ let the segment Cd\nhave been added, so that the whole line DCC’ exceeds the line EA’ by\nthe segment CD and the segment CF; therefore it exceeds the line Bb’\nby the segment CD. (See diagram.)\nThese names, both loss and gain, have come from voluntary ex-\nchange; for to have more than one’s own is called gaining, and to have\nless than one’s original share is called losing, e.g., in buying and selling\nand in all other matters in which the law has left people free to make\ntheir own terms; but when they get neither more nor less but just what\nbelongs to themselves, they say that they have their own and that they\nneither lose nor gain.\nTherefore the just is intermediate between a sort of gain and a sort\nof loss, viz. those which are involuntary; it consists in having an equal\namount before and after the transaction.",

    "text": "Some think that reciprocity is without qualification just, as the\nPythagoreans said; for they defined justice without qualification as reci-\nprocity. Now ‘reciprocity’ fits neither distributive nor rectificatory jus-\ntice-yet people want even the justice of Rhadamanthus to mean this:\nShould a man suffer what he did, right justice would be done—for\nin many cases reciprocity and rectificatory justice are not in accord;\ne.g., (1) if an official has inflicted a wound, he should not be wounded in\nreturn, and if some one has wounded an official, he ought not to be\nwounded only but punished in addition. Further (2) there is a great dif-\nference between a voluntary and an involuntary act. But in associations\nfor exchange this sort of justice does hold men together—reciprocity in\naccordance with a proportion and not on the basis of precisely equal\nreturn. For it is by proportionate requital that the city holds together.\nMen seek to return either evil for evil—and if they cana not do so, think\ntheir position mere slavery—or good for good—and if they cannot do\nso there is no exchange, but it is by exchange that they hold together.\nThis is why they give a prominent place to the temple of the Graces—to\npromote the requital of services; for this is characteristic of grace—we\nshould serve in return one who has shown grace to us, and should an-\nother time take the initiative in showing it.\nNow proportionate return is secured by cross-conjunction. Let A be\na builder, B a shoemaker, C a house, D a shoe. The builder, then, must\nget from the shoemaker the latter’s work, and must himself give him in\nreturn his own. If, then, first there is proportionate equality of goods,\nand then reciprocal action takes place, the result we mention will be\neffected. If not, the bargain is not equal, and does not hold; for there is\nnothing to prevent the work of the one being better than that of the other;\nthey must therefore be equated. (And this is true of the other arts also;\nfor they would have been destroyed if what the patient suffered had not\nbeen just what the agent did, and of the same amount and kind.) For it is\nnot two doctors that associate for exchange, but a doctor and a farmer,\nor in general people who are different and unequal; but these must be\nequated. This is why all things that are exchanged must be somehow\ncomparable. It is for this end that money has been introduced, and it\nbecomes in a sense an intermediate; for it measures all things, and there-\nfore the excess and the defect-how many shoes are equal to a house or to\na given amount of food. The number of shoes exchanged for a house (or\nfor a given amount of food) must therefore correspond to the ratio of\nbuilder to shoemaker. For if this be not so, there will be no exchange and\nno intercourse. And this proportion will not be effected unless the goods\nare somehow equal. All goods must therefore be measured by some one\nthing, as we said before. Now this unit is in truth demand, which holds\nall things together (for if men did not need one another’s goods at all, or\ndid not need them equally, there would be either no exchange or not the\nsame exchange); but money has become by convention a sort of repre-\nsentative of demand; and this is why it has the name ‘money’ (nomisma)—\nbecause it exists not by nature but by law (nomos) and it is in our power\nto change it and make it useless. There will, then, be reciprocity when\nthe terms have been equated so that as farmer is to shoemaker, the amount\nof the shoemaker’s work is to that of the farmer’s work for which it\nexchanges. But we must not bring them into a figure of proportion when\nthey have already exchanged (otherwise one extreme will have both ex-\ncesses), but when they still have their own goods. Thus they are equals\nand associates just because this equality can be effected in their case.\nLet A be a farmer, C food, B a shoemaker, D his product equated to C.\nIf it had not been possible for reciprocity to be thus effected, there would\nhave been no association of the parties. That demand holds things to-\ngether as a single unit is shown by the fact that when men do not need\none another, i.e., when neither needs the other or one does not need the\nother, they do not exchange, as we do when some one wants what one\nhas oneself, e.g., when people permit the exportation of corn in ex-\nchange for wine. This equation therefore must be established. And for\nthe future exchange—that if we do not need a thing now we shall have it\nif ever we do need it—money is as it were our surety; for it must be\npossible for us to get what we want by bringing the money. Now the\nsame thing happens to money itself as to goods—it is not always worth\nthe same; yet it tends to be steadier. This is why all goods must have a\nprice set on them; for then there will always be exchange, and if so,\nassociation of man with man. Money, then, acting as a measure, makes\ngoods commensurate and equates them; for neither would there have\nbeen association if there were not exchange, nor exchange if there were\nnot equality, nor equality if there were not commensurability. Now in\ntruth it is impossible that things differing so much should become com-\nmensurate, but with reference to demand they may become so suffi-\nciently. There must, then, be a unit, and that fixed by agreement (for\nwhich reason it is called money); for it is this that makes all things\ncommensurate, since all things are measured by money. Let A be a house,\nB ten minae, C a bed. A is half of B, if the house is worth five minae or\nequal to them; the bed, C, is a tenth of B; it is plain, then, how many\nbeds are equal to a house, viz., five. That exchange took place thus\nbefore there was money is plain; for it makes no difference whether it is\nfive beds that exchange for a house, or the money value of five beds.\nWe have now defined the unjust and the just. These having been\nmarked off from each other, it is plain that just action is intermediate\nbetween acting unjustly and being unjustly treated; for the one is to have\ntoo much and the other to have too little. Justice is a kind of mean, but\nnot in the same way as the other virtues, but because it relates to an\nintermediate amount, while injustice relates to the extremes. And justice\nis that in virtue of which the just man is said to be a doer, by choice, of\nthat which is just, and one who will distribute either between himself\nand another or between two others not so as to give more of what is\ndesirable to himself and less to his neighbour (and conversely with what\nis harmful), but so as to give what is equal in accordance with propor-\ntion; and similarly in distributing between two other persons. Injustice\non the other hand is similarly related to the unjust, which is excess and\ndefect, contrary to proportion, of the useful or hurtful. For which reason\ninjustice is excess and defect, viz. because it is productive of excess and\ndefect-in one’s own case excess of what is in its own nature useful and\ndefect of what is hurtful, while in the case of others it is as a whole like\nwhat it is in one’s own case, but proportion may be violated in either\ndirection. In the unjust act to have too little is to be unjustly treated; to\nhave too much is to act unjustly.\nLet this be taken as our account of the nature of justice and injus-\ntice, and similarly of the just and the unjust in general.",

    "text": "Since acting unjustly does not necessarily imply being unjust, we must\nask what sort of unjust acts imply that the doer is unjust with respect to\neach type of injustice, e.g., a thief, an adulterer, or a brigand. Surely the\nanswer does not turn on the difference between these types. For a man\nmight even lie with a woman knowing who she was, but the origin of his\nmight be not deliberate choice but passion. He acts unjustly, then, but is\nnot unjust; e.g., a man is not a thief, yet he stole, nor an adulterer, yet he\ncommitted adultery; and similarly in all other cases.\nNow we have previously stated how the reciprocal is related to the\njust; but we must not forget that what we are looking for is not only\nwhat is just without qualification but also political justice. This is found\namong men who share their life with a view to self-sufficiency, men who\nare free and either proportionately or arithmetically equal, so that be-\ntween those who do not fulfil this condition there is no political justice\nbut justice in a special sense and by analogy. For justice exists only\nbetween men whose mutual relations are governed by law; and law ex-\nists for men between whom there is injustice; for legal justice is the\ndiscrimination of the just and the unjust. And between men between\nwhom there is injustice there is also unjust action (though there is not\ninjustice between all between whom there is unjust action), and this is\nassigning too much to oneself of things good in themselves and too little\nof things evil in themselves. This is why we do not allow a man to rule,\nbut rational principle, because a man behaves thus in his own interests\nand becomes a tyrant. The magistrate on the other hand is the guardian\nof justice, and, if of justice, then of equality also. And since he is as-\nsumed to have no more than his share, if he is just (for he does not\nassign to himself more of what is good in itself, unless such a share is\nproportional to his merits—so that it is for others that he labours, and it\nis for this reason that men, as we stated previously, say that justice is\n‘another’s good’), therefore a reward must be given him, and this is\nhonour and privilege; but those for whom such things are not enough\nbecome tyrants.\nThe justice of a master and that of a father are not the same as the\njustice of citizens, though they are like it; for there can be no injustice in\nthe unqualified sense towards thing that are one’s own, but a man’s\nchattel, and his child until it reaches a certain age and sets up for itself,\nare as it were part of himself, and no one chooses to hurt himself (for\nwhich reason there can be no injustice towards oneself). Therefore the\njustice or injustice of citizens is not manifested in these relations; for it\nwas as we saw according to law, and between people naturally subject\nto law, and these as we saw’ are people who have an equal share in\nruling and being ruled. Hence justice can more truly be manifested to-\nwards a wife than towards children and chattels, for the former is house-\nhold justice; but even this is different from political justice.",

    "text": "Of political justice part is natural, part legal, natural, that which every-\nwhere has the same force and does not exist by people’s thinking this or\nthat; legal, that which is originally indifferent, but when it has been laid\ndown is not indifferent, e.g., that a prisoner’s ransom shall be a mina, or\nthat a goat and not two sheep shall be sacrificed, and again all the laws\nthat are passed for particular cases, e.g., that sacrifice shall be made in\nhonour of Brasidas, and the provisions of decrees. Now some think that\nall justice is of this sort, because that which is by nature is unchange-\nable and has everywhere the same force (as fire burns both here and in\nPersia), while they see change in the things recognized as just. This,\nhowever, is not true in this unqualified way, but is true in a sense; or\nrather, with the gods it is perhaps not true at all, while with us there is\nsomething that is just even by nature, yet all of it is changeable; but still\nsome is by nature, some not by nature. It is evident which sort of thing,\namong things capable of being otherwise, is by nature, and which is not\nbut is legal and conventional, assuming that both are equally change-\nable. And in all other things the same distinction will apply; by nature\nthe right hand is stronger, yet it is possible that all men should come to\nbe ambidextrous. The things which are just by virtue of convention and\nexpediency are like measures; for wine and corn measures are not ev-\nerywhere equal, but larger in wholesale and smaller in retail markets.\nSimilarly, the things which are just not by nature but by human enact-\nment are not everywhere the same, since constitutions also are not the\nsame, though there is but one which is everywhere by nature the best.\nOf things just and lawful each is related as the universal to its particu-\nlars; for the things that are done are many, but of them each is one, since\nit is universal.\nThere is a difference between the act of injustice and what is unjust,\nand between the act of justice and what is just; for a thing is unjust by\nnature or by enactment; and this very thing, when it has been done, is an\nact of injustice, but before it is done is not yet that but is unjust. So, too,\nwith an act of justice (though the general term is rather ‘just action,’ and\n‘act of justice’ is applied to the correction of the act of injustice).\nEach of these must later be examined separately with regard to the\nnature and number of its species and the nature of the things with which\nit is concerned.",

    "text": "Acts just and unjust being as we have described them, a man acts un-\njustly or justly whenever he does such acts voluntarily; when involun-\ntarily, he acts neither unjustly nor justly except in an incidental way; for\nhe does things which happen to be just or unjust. Whether an act is or is\nnot one of injustice (or of justice) is determined by its voluntariness or\ninvoluntariness; for when it is voluntary it is blamed, and at the same\ntime is then an act of injustice; so that there will be things that are unjust\nbut not yet acts of injustice, if voluntariness be not present as well. By\nthe voluntary I mean, as has been said before, any of the things in a\nman’s own power which he does with knowledge, i.e., not in ignorance\neither of the person acted on or of the instrument used or of the end that\nwill be attained (e.g., whom he is striking, with what, and to what end),\neach such act being done not incidentally nor under compulsion (e.g., if\nA takes B’s hand and therewith strikes C, B does not act voluntarily; for\nthe act was not in his own power). The person struck may be the striker’s\nfather, and the striker may know that it is a man or one of the persons\npresent, but not know that it is his father; a similar distinction may be\nmade in the case of the end, and with regard to the whole action. There-\nfore that which is done in ignorance, or though not done in ignorance is\nnot in the agent’s power, or is done under compulsion, is involuntary\n(for many natural processes, even, we knowingly both perform and ex-\nperience, none of which is either voluntary or involuntary; e.g., growing\nold or dying). But in the case of unjust and just acts alike the injustice or\njustice may be only incidental; for a man might return a deposit unwill-\ningly and from fear, and then he must not be said either to do what is just\nor to act justly, except in an incidental way. Similarly the man who\nunder compulsion and unwillingly fails to return the deposit must be\nsaid to act unjustly, and to do what is unjust, only incidentally. Of vol-\nuntary acts we do some by choice, others not by choice; by choice those\nwhich we do after deliberation, not by choice those which we do without\nprevious deliberation. Thus there are three kinds of injury in transac-\ntions between man and man; those done in ignorance are mistakes when\nthe person acted on, the act, the instrument, or the end that will be at-\ntained is other than the agent supposed; the agent thought either that he\nwas not hiting any one or that he was not hitting with this missile or not\nhitting this person or to this end, but a result followed other than that\nwhich he thought likely (e.g., he threw not with intent to wound but only\nto prick), or the person hit or the missile was other than he supposed.\nNow when (1) the injury takes place contrary to reasonable expectation,\nit is a misadventure. When (2) it is not contrary to reasonable expecta-\ntion, but does not imply vice, it is a mistake (for a man makes a mistake\nwhen the fault originates in him, but is the victim of accident when the\norigin lies outside him). When (3) he acts with knowledge but not after\ndeliberation, it is an act of injustice—e.g., the acts due to anger or to\nother passions necessary or natural to man; for when men do such harmful\nand mistaken acts they act unjustly, and the acts are acts of injustice,\nbut this does not imply that the doers are unjust or wicked; for the injury\nis not due to vice. But when (4) a man acts from choice, he is an unjust\nman and a vicious man.\nHence acts proceeding from anger are rightly judged not to be done\nof malice aforethought; for it is not the man who acts in anger but he\nwho enraged him that starts the mischief. Again, the matter in dispute is\nnot whether the thing happened or not, but its justice; for it is apparent\ninjustice that occasions rage. For they do not dispute about the occur-\nrence of the act-as in commercial transactions where one of the two\nparties must be vicious-unless they do so owing to forgetfulness; but,\nagreeing about the fact, they dispute on which side justice lies (whereas\na man who has deliberately injured another cannot help knowing that he\nhas done so), so that the one thinks he is being treated unjustly and the\nother disagrees.\nBut if a man harms another by choice, he acts unjustly; and these\nare the acts of injustice which imply that the doer is an unjust man,\nprovided that the act violates proportion or equality. Similarly, a man is\njust when he acts justly by choice; but he acts justly if he merely acts\nvoluntarily.\nOf involuntary acts some are excusable, others not. For the mis-\ntakes which men make not only in ignorance but also from ignorance\nare excusable, while those which men do not from ignorance but (though\nthey do them in ignorance) owing to a passion which is neither natural\nnor such as man is liable to, are not excusable.",

    "text": "Assuming that we have sufficiently defined the suffering and doing of\ninjustice, it may be asked (1) whether the truth in expressed in Euripides’\nparadoxical words:\nI slew my mother, that’s my tale in brief. Were you both willing, or\nunwilling both?\nIs it truly possible to be willingly treated unjustly, or is all suffering\nof injustice the contrary involuntary, as all unjust action is voluntary?\nAnd is all suffering of injustice of the latter kind or else all of the former,\nor is it sometimes voluntary, sometimes involuntary? So, too, with the\ncase of being justly treated; all just action is voluntary, so that it is\nreasonable that there should be a similar opposition in either case—that\nboth being unjustly and being justly treated should be either alike volun-\ntary or alike involuntary. But it would be thought paradoxical even in\nthe case of being justly treated, if it were always voluntary; for some are\nunwillingly treated justly. (2) One might raise this question also, whether\nevery one who has suffered what is unjust is being unjustly treated, or\non the other hand it is with suffering as with acting. In action and in\npassivity alike it is possible to partake of justice incidentally, and simi-\nlarly (it is plain) of injustice; for to do what is unjust is not the same as\nto act unjustly, nor to suffer what is unjust as to be treated unjustly, and\nsimilarly in the case of acting justly and being justly treated; for it is\nimpossible to be unjustly treated if the other does not act unjustly, or\njustly treated unless he acts justly. Now if to act unjustly is simply to\nharm some one voluntarily, and ‘voluntarily’ means ‘knowing the per-\nson acted on, the instrument, and the manner of one’s acting,’ and the\nincontinent man voluntarily harms himself, not only will he voluntarily\nbe unjustly treated but it will be possible to treat oneself unjustly. (This\nalso is one of the questions in doubt, whether a man can treat himself\nunjustly.) Again, a man may voluntarily, owing to incontinence, be\nharmed by another who acts voluntarily, so that it would be possible to\nbe voluntarily treated unjustly. Or is our definition incorrect; must we to\n‘harming another, with knowledge both of the person acted on, of the\ninstrument, and of the manner’ add ‘contrary to the wish of the person\nacted on’? Then a man may be voluntarily harmed and voluntarily suf-\nfer what is unjust, but no one is voluntarily treated unjustly; for no one\nwishes to be unjustly treated, not even the incontinent man. He acts\ncontrary to his wish; for no one wishes for what he does not think to be\ngood, but the incontinent man does do things that he does not think he\nought to do. Again, one who gives what is his own, as Homer says\nGlaucus gave Diomede\nArmour of gold for brazen, the price of a hundred beeves for nine, is\nnot unjustly treated; for though to give is in his power, to be unjustly\ntreated is not, but there must be some one to treat him unjustly. It is\nplain, then, that being unjustly treated is not voluntary.\nOf the questions we intended to discuss two still remain for discus-\nsion; (3) whether it is the man who has assigned to another more than\nhis share that acts unjustly, or he who has the excessive share, and (4)\nwhether it is possible to treat oneself unjustly. The questions are con-\nnected; for if the former alternative is possible and the distributor acts\nunjustly and not the man who has the excessive share, then if a man\nassigns more to another than to himself, knowingly and voluntarily, he\ntreats himself unjustly; which is what modest people seem to do, since\nthe virtuous man tends to take less than his share. Or does this statement\ntoo need qualification? For (a) he perhaps gets more than his share of\nsome other good, e.g., of honour or of intrinsic nobility. (b) The ques-\ntion is solved by applying the distinction we applied to unjust action; for\nhe suffers nothing contrary to his own wish, so that he is not unjustly\ntreated as far as this goes, but at most only suffers harm.\nIt is plain too that the distributor acts unjustly, but not always the\nman who has the excessive share; for it is not he to whom what is unjust\nappertains that acts unjustly, but he to whom it appertains to do the\nunjust act voluntarily, i.e., the person in whom lies the origin of the\naction, and this lies in the distributor, not in the receiver. Again, since\nthe word ‘do’ is ambiguous, and there is a sense in which lifeless things,\nor a hand, or a servant who obeys an order, may be said to slay, he who\ngets an excessive share does not act unjustly, though he ‘does’ what is\nunjust.\nAgain, if the distributor gave his judgement in ignorance, he does\nnot act unjustly in respect of legal justice, and his judgement is not\nunjust in this sense, but in a sense it is unjust (for legal justice and\nprimordial justice are different); but if with knowledge he judged un-\njustly, he is himself aiming at an excessive share either of gratitude or of\nrevenge. As much, then, as if he were to share in the plunder, the man\nwho has judged unjustly for these reasons has got too much; the fact\nthat what he gets is different from what he distributes makes no differ-\nence, for even if he awards land with a view to sharing in the plunder he\ngets not land but money.\nMen think that acting unjustly is in their power, and therefore that\nbeing just is easy. But it is not; to lie with one’s neighbour’s wife, to\nwound another, to deliver a bribe, is easy and in our power, but to do\nthese things as a result of a certain state of character is neither easy nor\nin our power. Similarly to know what is just and what is unjust requires,\nmen think, no great wisdom, because it is not hard to understand the\nmatters dealt with by the laws (though these are not the things that are\njust, except incidentally); but how actions must be done and distribu-\ntions effected in order to be just, to know this is a greater achievement\nthan knowing what is good for the health; though even there, while it is\neasy to know that honey, wine, hellebore, cautery, and the use of the\nknife are so, to know how, to whom, and when these should be applied\nwith a view to producing health, is no less an achievement than that of\nbeing a physician. Again, for this very reason men think that acting\nunjustly is characteristic of the just man no less than of the unjust, be-\ncause he would be not less but even more capable of doing each of these\nunjust acts; for he could lie with a woman or wound a neighbour; and\nthe brave man could throw away his shield and turn to flight in this\ndirection or in that. But to play the coward or to act unjustly consists\nnot in doing these things, except incidentally, but in doing them as the\nresult of a certain state of character, just as to practise medicine and\nhealing consists not in applying or not applying the knife, in using or not\nusing medicines, but in doing so in a certain way.\nJust acts occur between people who participate in things good in\nthemselves and can have too much or too little of them; for some beings\n(e.g., presumably the gods) cannot have too much of them, and to oth-\ners, those who are incurably bad, not even the smallest share in them is\nbeneficial but all such goods are harmful, while to others they are ben-\neficial up to a point; therefore justice is essentially something human.\n10 Our next subject is equity and the equitable (to epiekes), and\ntheir respective relations to justice and the just. For on examination they\nappear to be neither absolutely the same nor generically different; and\nwhile we sometime praise what is equitable and the equitable man (so\nthat we apply the name by way of praise even to instances of the other\nvirtues, instead of ‘good’ meaning by epieikestebon that a thing is bet-\nter), at other times, when we reason it out, it seems strange if the equi-\ntable, being something different from the just, is yet praiseworthy; for\neither the just or the equitable is not good, if they are different; or, if\nboth are good, they are the same.\nThese, then, are pretty much the considerations that give rise to the\nproblem about the equitable; they are all in a sense correct and not\nopposed to one another; for the equitable, though it is better than one\nkind of justice, yet is just, and it is not as being a different class of thing\nthat it is better than the just. The same thing, then, is just and equitable,\nand while both are good the equitable is superior. What creates the prob-\nlem is that the equitable is just, but not the legally just but a correction\nof legal justice. The reason is that all law is universal but about some\nthings it is not possible to make a universal statement which shall be\ncorrect. In those cases, then, in which it is necessary to speak univer-\nsally, but not possible to do so correctly, the law takes the usual case,\nthough it is not ignorant of the possibility of error. And it is none the less\ncorrect; for the error is in the law nor in the legislator but in the nature\nof the thing, since the matter of practical affairs is of this kind from the\nstart. When the law speaks universally, then, and a case arises on it\nwhich is not covered by the universal statement, then it is right, where\nthe legislator fails us and has erred by oversimplicity, to correct the\nomission—to say what the legislator himself would have said had he\nbeen present, and would have put into his law if he had known. Hence\nthe equitable is just, and better than one kind of justice—not better than\nabsolute justice but better than the error that arises from the absolute-\nness of the statement. And this is the nature of the equitable, a correc-\ntion of law where it is defective owing to its universality. In fact this is\nthe reason why all things are not determined by law, that about some\nthings it is impossible to lay down a law, so that a decree is needed. For\nwhen the thing is indefinite the rule also is indefinite, like the leaden rule\nused in making the Lesbian moulding; the rule adapts itself to the shape\nof the stone and is not rigid, and so too the decree is adapted to the facts.\nIt is plain, then, what the equitable is, and that it is just and is better\nthan one kind of justice. It is evident also from this who the equitable\nman is; the man who chooses and does such acts, and is no stickler for\nhis rights in a bad sense but tends to take less than his share though he\nhas the law oft his side, is equitable, and this state of character is equity,\nwhich is a sort of justice and not a different state of character.",

    "text": "Whether a man can treat himself unjustly or not, is evident from what\nhas been said. For (a) one class of just acts are those acts in accordance\nwith any virtue which are prescribed by the law; e.g., the law does not\nexpressly permit suicide, and what it does not expressly permit it for-\nbids. Again, when a man in violation of the law harms another (other-\nwise than in retaliation) voluntarily, he acts unjustly, and a voluntary\nagent is one who knows both the person he is affecting by his action and\nthe instrument he is using; and he who through anger voluntarily stabs\nhimself does this contrary to the right rule of life, and this the law does\nnot allow; therefore he is acting unjustly. But towards whom? Surely\ntowards the state, not towards himself. For he suffers voluntarily, but\nno one is voluntarily treated unjustly. This is also the reason why the\nstate punishes; a certain loss of civil rights attaches to the man who\ndestroys himself, on the ground that he is treating the state unjustly.\nFurther (b) in that sense of ‘acting unjustly’ in which the man who\n‘acts unjustly’ is unjust only and not bad all round, it is not possible to\ntreat oneself unjustly (this is different from the former sense; the unjust\nman in one sense of the term is wicked in a particularized way just as the\ncoward is, not in the sense of being wicked all round, so that his ‘unjust\nact’ does not manifest wickedness in general). For (i) that would imply\nthe possibility of the same thing’s having been subtracted from and added\nto the same thing at the same time; but this is impossible—the just and\nthe unjust always involve more than one person. Further, (ii) unjust\naction is voluntary and done by choice, and takes the initiative (for the\nman who because he has suffered does the same in return is not thought\nto act unjustly); but if a man harms himself he suffers and does the same\nthings at the same time. Further, (iii) if a man could treat himself un-\njustly, he could be voluntarily treated unjustly. Besides, (iv) no one acts\nunjustly without committing particular acts of injustice; but no one can\ncommit adultery with his own wife or housebreaking on his own house\nor theft on his own property,\nIn general, the question ‘can a man treat himself unjustly?’ is solved\nalso by the distinction we applied to the question ‘can a man be volun-\ntarily treated unjustly?’\n(It is evident too that both are bad, being unjustly treated and acting\nunjustly; for the one means having less and the other having more than\nthe intermediate amount, which plays the part here that the healthy does\nin the medical art, and that good condition does in the art of bodily\ntraining. But still acting unjustly is the worse, for it involves vice and is\nblameworthy—involves vice which is either of the complete and un-\nqualified kind or almost so (we must admit the latter alternative, be-\ncause not all voluntary unjust action implies injustice as a state of char-\nacter), while being unjustly treated does not involve vice and injustice in\noneself. In itself, then, being unjustly treated is less bad, but there is\nnothing to prevent its being incidentally a greater evil. But theory cares\nnothing for this; it calls pleurisy a more serious mischief than a stumble;\nyet the latter may become incidentally the more serious, if the fall due to\nit leads to your being taken prisoner or put to death the enemy.)\nMetaphorically and in virtue of a certain resemblance there is a\njustice, not indeed between a man and himself, but between certain parts\nof him; yet not every kind of justice but that of master and servant or\nthat of husband and wife. For these are the ratios in which the part of the\nsoul that has a rational principle stands to the irrational part; and it is\nwith a view to these parts that people also think a man can be unjust to\nhimself, viz., because these parts are liable to suffer something contrary\nto their respective desires; there is therefore thought to be a mutual\njustice between them as between ruler and ruled.\nLet this be taken as our account of justice and the other, i.e., the\nother moral, virtues.",

In all the states of character we have mentioned, as in all\nother matters, there is a mark to which the man who has the rule looks,\nand heightens or relaxes his activity accordingly, and there is a standard\nwhich determines the mean states which we say are intermediate be-\ntween excess and defect, being in accordance with the right rule. But\nsuch a statement, though true, is by no means clear; for not only here\nbut in all other pursuits which are objects of knowledge it is indeed true\nto say that we must not exert ourselves nor relax our efforts too much\nnor too little, but to an intermediate extent and as the right rule dictates;\nbut if a man had only this knowledge he would be none the wiser e.g.,\nwe should not know what sort of medicines to apply to our body if some\none were to say ‘all those which the medical art prescribes, and which\nagree with the practice of one who possesses the art’. Hence it is neces-\nsary with regard to the states of the soul also not only that this true\nstatement should be made, but also that it should be determined what is\nthe right rule and what is the standard that fixes it.\nWe divided the virtues of the soul and a said that some are virtues of\ncharacter and others of intellect. Now we have discussed in detail the\nmoral virtues; with regard to the others let us express our view as fol-\nlows, beginning with some remarks about the soul. We said before that\nthere are two parts of the soul—that which grasps a rule or rational\nprinciple, and the irrational; let us now draw a similar distinction within\nthe part which grasps a rational principle. And let it be assumed that\nthere are two parts which grasp a rational principle—one by which we\ncontemplate the kind of things whose originative causes are invariable,\nand one by which we contemplate variable things; for where objects\ndiffer in kind the part of the soul answering to each of the two is differ-\nent in kind, since it is in virtue of a certain likeness and kinship with\ntheir objects that they have the knowledge they have. Let one of these\nparts be called the scientific and the other the calculative; for to deliber-\nate and to calculate are the same thing, but no one deliberates about the\ninvariable. Therefore the calculative is one part of the faculty which\ngrasps a rational principle. We must, then, learn what is the best state of\neach of these two parts; for this is the virtue of each.",

    "text": "The virtue of a thing is relative to its proper work. Now there are three\nthings in the soul which control action and truth-sensation, reason, de-\nsire.\nOf these sensation originates no action; this is plain from the fact\nthat the lower animals have sensation but no share in action.\nWhat affirmation and negation are in thinking, pursuit and avoid-\nance are in desire; so that since moral virtue is a state of character\nconcerned with choice, and choice is deliberate desire, therefore both\nthe reasoning must be true and the desire right, if the choice is to be\ngood, and the latter must pursue just what the former asserts. Now this\nkind of intellect and of truth is practical; of the intellect which is con-\ntemplative, not practical nor productive, the good and the bad state are\ntruth and falsity respectively (for this is the work of everything intellec-\ntual); while of the part which is practical and intellectual the good state\nis truth in agreement with right desire.\nThe origin of action—its efficient, not its final cause—is choice,\nand that of choice is desire and reasoning with a view to an end. This is\nwhy choice cannot exist either without reason and intellect or without a\nmoral state; for good action and its opposite cannot exist without a\ncombination of intellect and character. Intellect itself, however, moves\nnothing, but only the intellect which aims at an end and is practical; for\nthis rules the productive intellect, as well, since every one who makes\nmakes for an end, and that which is made is not an end in the unqualified\nsense (but only an end in a particular relation, and the end of a particu-\nlar operation)—only that which is done is that; for good action is an\nend, and desire aims at this. Hence choice is either desiderative reason\nor ratiocinative desire, and such an origin of action is a man. (It is to be\nnoted that nothing that is past is an object of choice, e.g., no one chooses\nto have sacked Troy; for no one deliberates about the past, but about\nwhat is future and capable of being otherwise, while what is past is not\ncapable of not having taken place; hence Agathon is right in saying\nFor this alone is lacking even to God, To make undone things thathave\nonce been done.)\nThe work of both the intellectual parts, then, is truth. Therefore the\nstates that are most strictly those in respect of which each of these parts\nwill reach truth are the virtues of the two parts.",

    "text": "Let us begin, then, from the beginning, and discuss these states once\nmore. Let it be assumed that the states by virtue of which the soul pos-\nsesses truth by way of affirmation or denial are five in number, i.e., art,\nscientific knowledge, practical wisdom, philosophic wisdom, intuitive\nreason; we do not include judgement and opinion because in these we\nmay be mistaken.\nNow what scientific knowledge is, if we are to speak exactly and\nnot follow mere similarities, is plain from what follows. We all suppose\nthat what we know is not even capable of being otherwise; of things\ncapable of being otherwise we do not know, when they have passed\noutside our observation, whether they exist or not. Therefore the object\nof scientific knowledge is of necessity. Therefore it is eternal; for things\nthat are of necessity in the unqualified sense are all eternal; and things\nthat are eternal are ungenerated and imperishable. Again, every science\nis thought to be capable of being taught, and its object of being learned.\nAnd all teaching starts from what is already known, as we maintain in\nthe Analytics also; for it proceeds sometimes through induction and\nsometimes by syllogism. Now induction is the starting-point which knowl-\nedge even of the universal presupposes, while syllogism proceeds from\nuniversals. There are therefore starting-points from which syllogism\nproceeds, which are not reached by syllogism; it is therefore by induc-\ntion that they are acquired. Scientific knowledge is, then, a state of ca-\npacity to demonstrate, and has the other limiting characteristics which\nwe specify in the Analytics, for it is when a man believes in a certain\nway and the starting-points are known to him that he has scientific knowl-\nedge, since if they are not better known to him than the conclusion, he\nwill have his knowledge only incidentally.\nLet this, then, be taken as our account of scientific knowledge.",

    "text": "In the variable are included both things made and things done; making\nand acting are different (for their nature we treat even the discussions\noutside our school as reliable); so that the reasoned state of capacity to\nact is different from the reasoned state of capacity to make. Hence too\nthey are not included one in the other; for neither is acting making nor is\nmaking acting. Now since architecture is an art and is essentially a rea-\nsoned state of capacity to make, and there is neither any art that is not\nsuch a state nor any such state that is not an art, art is identical with a\nstate of capacity to make, involving a true course of reasoning. All art is\nconcerned with coming into being, i.e., with contriving and considering\nhow something may come into being which is capable of either being or\nnot being, and whose origin is in the maker and not in the thing made;\nfor art is concerned neither with things that are, or come into being, by\nnecessity, nor with things that do so in accordance with nature (since\nthese have their origin in themselves). Making and acting being differ-\nent, art must be a matter of making, not of acting. And in a sense chance\nand art are concerned with the same objects; as Agathon says, ‘art loves\nchance and chance loves art’. Art, then, as has been is a state concerned\nwith making, involving a true course of reasoning, and lack of art on the\ncontrary is a state concerned with making, involving a false course of\nreasoning; both are concerned with the variable.",

    "text": "Regarding practical wisdom we shall get at the truth by considering\nwho are the persons we credit with it. Now it is thought to be the mark\nof a man of practical wisdom to be able to deliberate well about what is\ngood and expedient for himself, not in some particular respect, e.g.,\nabout what sorts of thing conduce to health or to strength, but about\nwhat sorts of thing conduce to the good life in general. This is shown by\nthe fact that we credit men with practical wisdom in some particular\nrespect when they have calculated well with a view to some good end\nwhich is one of those that are not the object of any art. It follows that in\nthe general sense also the man who is capable of deliberating has prac-\ntical wisdom. Now no one deliberates about things that are invariable,\nnor about things that it is impossible for him to do. Therefore, since\nscientific knowledge involves demonstration, but there is no demonstra-\ntion of things whose first principles are variable (for all such things\nmight actually be otherwise), and since it is impossible to deliberate\nabout things that are of necessity, practical wisdom cannot be scientific\nknowledge nor art; not science because that which can be done is ca-\npable of being otherwise, not art because action and making are differ-\nent kinds of thing. The remaining alternative, then, is that it is a true and\nreasoned state of capacity to act with regard to the things that are good\nor bad for man. For while making has an end other than itself, action\ncannot; for good action itself is its end. It is for this reason that we think\nPericles and men like him have practical wisdom, viz. because they can\nsee what is good for themselves and what is good for men in general; we\nconsider that those can do this who are good at managing households or\nstates. (This is why we call temperance (sophrosune) by this name; we\nimply that it preserves one’s practical wisdom (sozousa tan phronsin).\nNow what it preserves is a judgement of the kind we have described.\nFor it is not any and every judgement that pleasant and painful objects\ndestroy and pervert, e.g., the judgement that the triangle has or has not\nits angles equal to two right angles, but only judgements about what is\nto be done. For the originating causes of the things that are done consist\nin the end at which they are aimed; but the man who has been ruined by\npleasure or pain forthwith fails to see any such originating cause—to\nsee that for the sake of this or because of this he ought to choose and do\nwhatever he chooses and does; for vice is destructive of the originating\ncause of action.) Practical wisdom, then, must be a reasoned and true\nstate of capacity to act with regard to human goods. But further, while\nthere is such a thing as excellence in art, there is no such thing as excel-\nlence in practical wisdom; and in art he who errs willingly is preferable,\nbut in practical wisdom, as in the virtues, he is the reverse. Plainly, then,\npractical wisdom is a virtue and not an art. There being two parts of the\nsoul that can follow a course of reasoning, it must be the virtue of one of\nthe two, i.e., of that part which forms opinions; for opinion is about the\nvariable and so is practical wisdom. But yet it is not only a reasoned\nstate; this is shown by the fact that a state of that sort may forgotten but\npractical wisdom cannot.",

This being so, the first principle from\nwhich what is scientifically known follows cannot be an object of scien-\ntific knowledge, of art, or of practical wisdom; for that which can be\nscientifically known can be demonstrated, and art and practical wisdom\ndeal with things that are variable. Nor are these first principles the ob-\njects of philosophic wisdom, for it is a mark of the philosopher to have\ndemonstration about some things. If, then, the states of mind by which\nwe have truth and are never deceived about things invariable or even\nvariable are scientific knowlededge, practical wisdom, philosophic wis-\ndom, and intuitive reason, and it cannot be any of the three (i.e., practi-\ncal wisdom, scientific knowledge, or philosophic wisdom), the remain-\ning alternative is that it is intuitive reason that grasps the first prin-\nciples.",

    "text": "Wisdom (1) in the arts we ascribe to their most finished exponents, e.g.,\nto Phidias as a sculptor and to Polyclitus as a maker of portrait-statues,\nand here we mean nothing by wisdom except excellence in art; but (2)\nwe think that some people are wise in general, not in some particular\nfield or in any other limited respect, as Homer says in the Margites,\nHim did the gods make neither a digger nor yet a ploughman\nNor wise in anything else. Therefore wisdom must plainly be the\nmost finished of the forms of knowledge. It follows that the wise man\nmust not only know what follows from the first principles, but must also\npossess truth about the first principles. Therefore wisdom must be intui-\ntive reason combined with scientific knowledge—scientific knowledge\nof the highest objects which has received as it were its proper comple-\ntion.\nOf the highest objects, we say; for it would be strange to think that\nthe art of politics, or practical wisdom, is the best knowledge, since man\nis not the best thing in the world. Now if what is healthy or good is\ndifferent for men and for fishes, but what is white or straight is always\nthe same, any one would say that what is wise is the same but what is\npractically wise is different; for it is to that which observes well the\nvarious matters concerning itself that one ascribes practical wisdom,\nand it is to this that one will entrust such matters. This is why we say\nthat some even of the lower animals have practical wisdom, viz. those\nwhich are found to have a power of foresight with regard to their own\nlife. It is evident also that philosophic wisdom and the art of politics\ncannot be the same; for if the state of mind concerned with a man’s own\ninterests is to be called philosophic wisdom, there will be many philo-\nsophic wisdoms; there will not be one concerned with the good of all\nanimals (any more than there is one art of medicine for all existing\nthings), but a different philosophic wisdom about the good of each spe-\ncies.\nBut if the argument be that man is the best of the animals, this\nmakes no difference; for there are other things much more divine in their\nnature even than man, e.g., most conspicuously, the bodies of which the\nheavens are framed. From what has been said it is plain, then, that philo-\nsophic wisdom is scientific knowledge, combined with intuitive reason,\nof the things that are highest by nature. This is why we say Anaxagoras,\nThales, and men like them have philosophic but not practical wisdom,\nwhen we see them ignorant of what is to their own advantage, and why\nwe say that they know things that are remarkable, admirable, difficult,\nand divine, but useless; viz., because it is not human goods that they\nseek.\nPractical wisdom on the other hand is concerned with things human\nand things about which it is possible to deliberate; for we say this is\nabove all the work of the man of practical wisdom, to deliberate well,\nbut no one deliberates about things invariable, nor about things which\nhave not an end, and that a good that can be brought about by action.\nThe man who is without qualification good at deliberating is the man\nwho is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for\nman of things attainable by action. Nor is practical wisdom concerned\nwith universals only—it must also recognize the particulars; for it is\npractical, and practice is concerned with particulars. This is why some\nwho do not know, and especially those who have experience, are more\npractical than others who know; for if a man knew that light meats are\ndigestible and wholesome, but did not know which sorts of meat are\nlight, he would not produce health, but the man who knows that chicken\nis wholesome is more likely to produce health.\nNow practical wisdom is concerned with action; therefore one should\nhave both forms of it, or the latter in preference to the former. But of\npractical as of philosophic wisdom there must be a controlling kind.",

    "text": "Political wisdom and practical wisdom are the same state of mind, but\ntheir essence is not the same. Of the wisdom concerned with the city, the\npractical wisdom which plays a controlling part is legislative wisdom,\nwhile that which is related to this as particulars to their universal is\nknown by the general name ‘political wisdom’; this has to do with ac-\ntion and deliberation, for a decree is a thing to be carried out in the form\nof an individual act. This is why the exponents of this art are alone said\nto ‘take part in politics’; for these alone ‘do things’ as manual labourers\n‘do things.’\nPractical wisdom also is identified especially with that form of it\nwhich is concerned with a man himself—with the individual; and this is\nknown by the general name ‘practical wisdom’; of the other kinds one is\ncalled household management, another legislation, the third politics, and\nof the latter one part is called deliberative and the other judicial. Now\nknowing what is good for oneself will be one kind of knowledge, but it\nis very different from the other kinds; and the man who knows and\nconcerns himself with his own interests is thought to have practical wis-\ndom, while politicians are thought to be busybodies; hence the word of\nEuripides,\nBut how could I be wise, who might at ease, Numbered among the\narmy’s multitude, Have had an equal share? For those who aim too high\nand do too much. Those who think thus seek their own good, and con-\nsider that one ought to do so. From this opinion, then, has come the view\nthat such men have practical wisdom; yet perhaps one’s own good can-\nnot exist without household management, nor without a form of govern-\nment. Further, how one should order one’s own affairs is not clear and\nneeds inquiry.\nWhat has been said is confirmed by the fact that while young men\nbecome geometricians and mathematicians and wise in matters like these,\nit is thought that a young man of practical wisdom cannot be found. The\ncause is that such wisdom is concerned not only with universals but\nwith particulars, which become familiar from experience, but a young\nman has no experience, for it is length of time that gives experience;\nindeed one might ask this question too, why a boy may become a math-\nematician, but not a philosopher or a physicist. It is because the objects\nof mathematics exist by abstraction, while the first principles of these\nother subjects come from experience, and because young men have no\nconviction about the latter but merely use the proper language, while the\nessence of mathematical objects is plain enough to them?\nFurther, error in deliberation may be either about the universal or\nabout the particular; we may fall to know either that all water that weighs\nheavy is bad, or that this particular water weighs heavy.\nThat practical wisdom is not scientific knowledge is evident; for it\nis, as has been said, concerned with the ultimate particular fact, since\nthe thing to be done is of this nature. It is opposed, then, to intuitive\nreason; for intuitive reason is of the limiting premisses, for which no\nreason can be given, while practical wisdom is concerned with the ulti-\nmate particular, which is the object not of scientific knowledge but of\nperception—not the perception of qualities peculiar to one sense but a\nperception akin to that by which we perceive that the particular figure\nbefore us is a triangle; for in that direction as well as in that of the major\npremiss there will be a limit. But this is rather perception than practical\nwisdom, though it is another kind of perception than that of the qualities\npeculiar to each sense.",

    "text": "There is a difference between inquiry and deliberation; for deliberation\nis inquiry into a particular kind of thing. We must grasp the nature of\nexcellence in deliberation as well whether it is a form of scientific knowl-\nedge, or opinion, or skill in conjecture, or some other kind of thing.\nScientific knowledge it is not; for men do not inquire about the things\nthey know about, but good deliberation is a kind of deliberation, and he\nwho deliberates inquires and calculates. Nor is it skill in conjecture; for\nthis both involves no reasoning and is something that is quick in its\noperation, while men deliberate a long time, and they say that one should\ncarry out quickly the conclusions of one’s deliberation, but should de-\nliberate slowly. Again, readiness of mind is different from excellence in\ndeliberation; it is a sort of skill in conjecture. Nor again is excellence in\ndeliberation opinion of any sort. But since the man who deliberates badly\nmakes a mistake, while he who deliberates well does so correctly, excel-\nlence in deliberation is clearly a kind of correctness, but neither of knowl-\nedge nor of opinion; for there is no such thing as correctness of knowl-\nedge (since there is no such thing as error of knowledge), and correct-\nness of opinion is truth; and at the same time everything that is an object\nof opinion is already determined. But again excellence in deliberation\ninvolves reasoning. The remaining alternative, then, is that it is correct-\nness of thinking; for this is not yet assertion, since, while even opinion is\nnot inquiry but has reached the stage of assertion, the man who is delib-\nerating, whether he does so well or ill, is searching for something and\ncalculating.\nBut excellence in deliberation is a certain correctness of delibera-\ntion; hence we must first inquire what deliberation is and what it is\nabout. And, there being more than one kind of correctness, plainly ex-\ncellence in deliberation is not any and every kind; for (1) the incontinent\nman and the bad man, if he is clever, will reach as a result of his calcu-\nlation what he sets before himself, so that he will have deliberated cor-\nrectly, but he will have got for himself a great evil. Now to have deliber-\nated well is thought to be a good thing; for it is this kind of correctness\nof deliberation that is excellence in deliberation, viz. that which tends to\nattain what is good. But (2) it is possible to attain even good by a false\nsyllogism, and to attain what one ought to do but not by the right means,\nthe middle term being false; so that this too is not yet excellence in\ndeliberation this state in virtue of which one attains what one ought but\nnot by the right means. Again (3) it is possible to attain it by long delib-\neration while another man attains it quickly. Therefore in the former\ncase we have not yet got excellence in deliberation, which is rightness\nwith regard to the expedient—rightness in respect both of the end, the\nmanner, and the time. (4) Further it is possible to have deliberated well\neither in the unqualified sense or with reference to a particular end.\nExcellence in deliberation in the unqualified sense, then, is that which\nsucceeds with reference to what is the end in the unqualified sense, and\nexcellence in deliberation in a particular sense is that which succeeds\nrelatively to a particular end. If, then, it is characteristic of men of prac-\ntical wisdom to have deliberated well, excellence in deliberation will be\ncorrectness with regard to what conduces to the end of which practical\nwisdom is the true apprehension.",

    "text": "Understanding, also, and goodness of understanding, in virtue of which\nmen are said to be men of understanding or of good understanding, are\nneither entirely the same as opinion or scientific knowledge (for at that\nrate all men would have been men of understanding), nor are they one of\nthe particular sciences, such as medicine, the science of things con-\nnected with health, or geometry, the science of spatial magnitudes. For\nunderstanding is neither about things that are always and are unchange-\nable, nor about any and every one of the things that come into being, but\nabout things which may become subjects of questioning and delibera-\ntion. Hence it is about the same objects as practical wisdom; but under-\nstanding and practical wisdom are not the same. For practical wisdom\nissues commands, since its end is what ought to be done or not to be\ndone; but understanding only judges. (Understanding is identical with\ngoodness of understanding, men of understanding with men of good\nunderstanding.) Now understanding is neither the having nor the ac-\nquiring of practical wisdom; but as learning is called understanding\nwhen it means the exercise of the faculty of knowledge, so ‘understand-\ning’ is applicable to the exercise of the faculty of opinion for the pur-\npose of judging of what some one else says about matters with which\npractical wisdom is concerned—and of judging soundly; for ‘well’ and\n‘soundly’ are the same thing. And from this has come the use of the\nname ‘understanding’ in virtue of which men are said to be ‘of good\nunderstanding,’ viz., from the application of the word to the grasping of\nscientific truth; for we often call such grasping understanding.",

    "text": "What is called judgement, in virtue of which men are said to ‘be sympa-\nthetic judges’ and to ‘have judgement,’ is the right discrimination of the\nequitable. This is shown by the fact that we say the equitable man is\nabove all others a man of sympathetic judgement, and identify equity\nwith sympathetic judgement about certain facts. And sympathetic judge-\nment is judgement which discriminates what is equitable and does so\ncorrectly; and correct judgement is that which judges what is true.\nNow all the states we have considered converge, as might be ex-\npected, to the same point; for when we speak of judgement and under-\nstanding and practical wisdom and intuitive reason we credit the same\npeople with possessing judgement and having reached years of reason\nand with having practical wisdom and understanding. For all these fac-\nulties deal with ultimates, i.e., with particulars; and being a man of\nunderstanding and of good or sympathetic judgement consists in being\nable judge about the things with which practical wisdom is concerned;\nfor the equities are common to all good men in relation to other men.\nNow all things which have to be done are included among particulars or\nultimates; for not only must the man of practical wisdom know particu-\nlar facts, but understanding and judgement are also concerned with things\nto be done, and these are ultimates. And intuitive reason is concerned\nwith the ultimates in both directions; for both the first terms and the last\nare objects of intuitive reason and not of argument, and the intuitive\nreason which is presupposed by demonstrations grasps the unchange-\nable and first terms, while the intuitive reason involved in practical rea-\nsonings grasps the last and variable fact, i.e., the minor premiss. For\nthese variable facts are the starting-points for the apprehension of the\nend, since the universals are reached from the particulars; of these there-\nfore we must have perception, and this perception is intuitive reason.\nThis is why these states are thought to be natural endowments—\nwhy, while no one is thought to be a philosopher by nature, people are\nthought to have by nature judgement, understanding, and intuitive rea-\nson. This is shown by the fact that we think our powers correspond to\nour time of life, and that a particular age brings with it intuitive reason\nand judgement; this implies that nature is the cause. (Hence intuitive\nreason is both beginning and end; for demonstrations are from these and\nabout these.) Therefore we ought to attend to the undemonstrated say-\nings and opinions of experienced and older people or of people of prac-\ntical wisdom not less than to demonstrations; for because experience\nhas given them an eye they see aright.\nWe have stated, then, what practical and philosophic wisdom are,\nand with what each of them is concerned, and we have said that each is\nthe virtue of a different part of the soul.",

    "text": "Difficulties might be raised as to the utility of these qualities of mind.\nFor (1) philosophic wisdom will contemplate none of the things that will\nmake a man happy (for it is not concerned with any coming into being),\nand though practical wisdom has this merit, for what purpose do we\nneed it? Practical wisdom is the quality of mind concerned with things\njust and noble and good for man, but these are the things which it is the\nmark of a good man to do, and we are none the more able to act for\nknowing them if the virtues are states of character, just as we are none\nthe better able to act for knowing the things that are healthy and sound,\nin the sense not of producing but of issuing from the state of health; for\nwe are none the more able to act for having the art of medicine or of\ngymnastics. But (2) if we are to say that a man should have practical\nwisdom not for the sake of knowing moral truths but for the sake of\nbecoming good, practical wisdom will be of no use to those who are\ngood; again it is of no use to those who have not virtue; for it will make\nno difference whether they have practical wisdom themselves or obey\nothers who have it, and it would be enough for us to do what we do in\nthe case of health; though we wish to become healthy, yet we do not\nlearn the art of medicine. (3) Besides this, it would be thought strange if\npractical wisdom, being inferior to philosophic wisdom, is to be put in\nauthority over it, as seems to be implied by the fact that the art which\nproduces anything rules and issues commands about that thing.\nThese, then, are the questions we must discuss; so far we have only\nstated the difficulties.\n(1) Now first let us say that in themselves these states must be wor-\nthy of choice because they are the virtues of the two parts of the soul\nrespectively, even if neither of them produce anything.\n(2) Secondly, they do produce something, not as the art of medicine\nproduces health, however, but as health produces health; so does philo-\nsophic wisdom produce happiness; for, being a part of virtue entire, by\nbeing possessed and by actualizing itself it makes a man happy.\n(3) Again, the work of man is achieved only in accordance with\npractical wisdom as well as with moral virtue; for virtue makes us aim\nat the right mark, and practical wisdom makes us take the right means.\n(Of the fourth part of the soul—the nutritive—there is no such virtue;\nfor there is nothing which it is in its power to do or not to do.)\n(4) With regard to our being none the more able to do because of\nour practical wisdom what is noble and just, let us begin a little further\nback, starting with the following principle. As we say that some people\nwho do just acts are not necessarily just, i.e., those who do the acts\nordained by the laws either unwillingly or owing to ignorance or for\nsome other reason and not for the sake of the acts themselves (though, to\nbe sure, they do what they should and all the things that the good man\nought), so is it, it seems, that in order to be good one must be in a certain\nstate when one does the several acts, i.e., one must do them as a result of\nchoice and for the sake of the acts themselves. Now virtue makes the\nchoice right, but the question of the things which should naturally be\ndone to carry out our choice belongs not to virtue but to another faculty.\nWe must devote our attention to these matters and give a clearer state-\nment about them. There is a faculty which is called cleverness; and this\nis such as to be able to do the things that tend towards the mark we have\nset before ourselves, and to hit it. Now if the mark be noble, the clever-\nness is laudable, but if the mark be bad, the cleverness is mere smart-\nness; hence we call even men of practical wisdom clever or smart. Prac-\ntical wisdom is not the faculty, but it does not exist without this faculty.\nAnd this eye of the soul acquires its formed state not without the aid of\nvirtue, as has been said and is plain; for the syllogisms which deal with\nacts to be done are things which involve a starting-point, viz., ‘since the\nend, i.e., what is best, is of such and such a nature,’ whatever it may be\n(let it for the sake of argument be what we please); and this is not evi-\ndent except to the good man; for wickedness perverts us and causes us\nto be deceived about the starting-points of action. Therefore it is evident\nthat it is impossible to be practically wise without being good.",

    "text": "We must therefore consider virtue also once more; for virtue too is simi-\nlarly related; as practical wisdom is to cleverness—not the same, but\nlike it—so is natural virtue to virtue in the strict sense. For all men think\nthat each type of character belongs to its possessors in some sense by\nnature; for from the very moment of birth we are just or fitted for\nselfcontrol or brave or have the other moral qualities; but yet we seek\nsomething else as that which is good in the strict sense—we seek for the\npresence of such qualities in another way. For both children and brutes\nhave the natural dispositions to these qualities, but without reason these\nare evidently hurtful. Only we seem to see this much, that, while one\nmay be led astray by them, as a strong body which moves without sight\nmay stumble badly because of its lack of sight, still, if a man once\nacquires reason, that makes a difference in action; and his state, while\nstill like what it was, will then be virtue in the strict sense. Therefore, as\nin the part of us which forms opinions there are two types, cleverness\nand practical wisdom, so too in the moral part there are two types,\nnatural virtue and virtue in the strict sense, and of these the latter in-\nvolves practical wisdom. This is why some say that all the virtues are\nforms of practical wisdom, and why Socrates in one respect was on the\nright track while in another he went astray; in thinking that all the vir-\ntues were forms of practical wisdom he was wrong, but in saying they\nimplied practical wisdom he was right. This is confirmed by the fact\nthat even now all men, when they define virtue, after naming the state of\ncharacter and its objects add ‘that (state) which is in accordance with\nthe right rule’; now the right rule is that which is in accordance with\npractical wisdom. All men, then, seem somehow to divine that this kind\nof state is virtue, viz. that which is in accordance with practical wis-\ndom. But we must go a little further. For it is not merely the state in\naccordance with the right rule, but the state that implies the presence of\nthe right rule, that is virtue; and practical wisdom is a right rule about\nsuch matters. Socrates, then, thought the virtues were rules or rational\nprinciples (for he thought they were, all of them, forms of scientific\nknowledge), while we think they involve a rational principle.\nIt is clear, then, from what has been said, that it is not possible to be\ngood in the strict sense without practical wisdom, nor practically wise\nwithout moral virtue. But in this way we may also refute the dialectical\nargument whereby it might be contended that the virtues exist in separa-\ntion from each other; the same man, it might be said, is not best equipped\nby nature for all the virtues, so that he will have already acquired one\nwhen he has not yet acquired another. This is possible in respect of the\nnatural virtues, but not in respect of those in respect of which a man is\ncalled without qualification good; for with the presence of the one qual-\nity, practical wisdom, will be given all the virtues. And it is plain that,\neven if it were of no practical value, we should have needed it because it\nis the virtue of the part of us in question; plain too that the choice will\nnot be right without practical wisdom any more than without virtue; for\nthe one deter, mines the end and the other makes us do the things that\nlead to the end.\nBut again it is not supreme over philosophic wisdom, i.e., over the\nsuperior part of us, any more than the art of medicine is over health; for\nit does not use it but provides for its coming into being; it issues orders,\nthen, for its sake, but not to it. Further, to maintain its supremacy would\nbe like saying that the art of politics rules the gods because it issues\norders about all the affairs of the state.",

    "text": "Let us now make a fresh beginning and point out that of moral states to\nbe avoided there are three kinds—vice, incontinence, brutishness. The\ncontraries of two of these are evident,—one we call virtue, the other\ncontinence; to brutishness it would be most fitting to oppose superhu-\nman virtue, a heroic and divine kind of virtue, as Homer has represented\nPriam saying of Hector that he was very good,\nFor he seemed not, he,\nThe child of a mortal man, but as one that of God’s seed came.\nTherefore if, as they say, men become gods by excess of virtue, of\nthis kind must evidently be the state opposed to the brutish state; for as\na brute has no vice or virtue, so neither has a god; his state is higher than\nvirtue, and that of a brute is a different kind of state from vice.\nNow, since it is rarely that a godlike man is found—to use the epi-\nthet of the Spartans, who when they admire any one highly call him a\n‘godlike man’—so too the brutish type is rarely found among men; it is\nfound chiefly among barbarians, but some brutish qualities are also\nproduced by disease or deformity; and we also call by this evil name\nthose men who go beyond all ordinary standards by reason of vice. Of\nthis kind of disposition, however, we must later make some mention,\nwhile we have discussed vice before we must now discuss incontinence\nand softness (or effeminacy), and continence and endurance; for we must\ntreat each of the two neither as identical with virtue or wickedness, nor\nas a different genus. We must, as in all other cases, set the observed\nfacts before us and, after first discussing the difficulties, go on to prove,\nif possible, the truth of all the common opinions about these affections\nof the mind, or, failing this, of the greater number and the most authori-\ntative; for if we both refute the objections and leave the common opin-\nions undisturbed, we shall have proved the case sufficiently.\nNow (1) both continence and endurance are thought to be included\namong things good and praiseworthy, and both incontinence and soft,\nness among things bad and blameworthy; and the same man is thought\nto be continent and ready to abide by the result of his calculations, or\nincontinent and ready to abandon them. And (2) the incontinent man,\nknowing that what he does is bad, does it as a result of passion, while\nthe continent man, knowing that his appetites are bad, refuses on ac-\ncount of his rational principle to follow them (3) The temperate man all\nmen call continent and disposed to endurance, while the continent man\nsome maintain to be always temperate but others do not; and some call\nthe self-indulgent man incontinent and the incontinent man selfindulgent\nindiscriminately, while others distinguish them. (4) The man of practi-\ncal wisdom, they sometimes say, cannot be incontinent, while some-\ntimes they say that some who are practically wise and clever are incon-\ntinent. Again (5) men are said to be incontinent even with respect to\nanger, honour, and gain.—These, then, are the things that are said.",

    "text": "Now we may ask (1) how a man who judges rightly can behave inconti-\nnently. That he should behave so when he has knowledge, some say is\nimpossible; for it would be strange—so Socrates thought—if when\nknowledge was in a man something else could master it and drag it\nabout like a slave. For Socrates was entirely opposed to the view in\nquestion, holding that there is no such thing as incontinence; no one, he\nsaid, when he judges acts against what he judges best—people act so\nonly by reason of ignorance. Now this view plainly contradicts the ob-\nserved facts, and we must inquire about what happens to such a man; if\nhe acts by reason of ignorance, what is the manner of his ignorance? For\nthat the man who behaves incontinently does not, before he gets into this\nstate, think he ought to act so, is evident. But there are some who con-\ncede certain of Socrates’ contentions but not others; that nothing is stron-\nger than knowledge they admit, but not that on one acts contrary to what\nhas seemed to him the better course, and therefore they say that the\nincontinent man has not knowledge when he is mastered by his plea-\nsures, but opinion. But if it is opinion and not knowledge, if it is not a\nstrong conviction that resists but a weak one, as in men who hesitate, we\nsympathize with their failure to stand by such convictions against strong\nappetites; but we do not sympathize with wickedness, nor with any of\nthe other blameworthy states. Is it then practical wisdom whose resis-\ntance is mastered? That is the strongest of all states. But this is absurd;\nthe same man will be at once practically wise and incontinent, but no\none would say that it is the part of a practically wise man to do willingly\nthe basest acts. Besides, it has been shown before that the man of prac-\ntical wisdom is one who will act (for he is a man concerned with the\nindividual facts) and who has the other virtues.\n(2) Further, if continence involves having strong and bad appetites,\nthe temperate man will not be continent nor the continent man temper-\nate; for a temperate man will have neither excessive nor bad appetites.\nBut the continent man must; for if the appetites are good, the state of\ncharacter that restrains us from following them is bad, so that not all\ncontinence will be good; while if they are weak and not bad, there is\nnothing admirable in resisting them, and if they are weak and bad, there\nis nothing great in resisting these either.\n(3) Further, if continence makes a man ready to stand by any and\nevery opinion, it is bad, i.e., if it makes him stand even by a false opin-\nion; and if incontinence makes a man apt to abandon any and every\nopinion, there will be a good incontinence, of which Sophocles’\nNeoptolemus in the Philoctetes will be an instance; for he is to be praised\nfor not standing by what Odysseus persuaded him to do, because he is\npained at telling a lie.\n(4) Further, the sophistic argument presents a difficulty; the syllo-\ngism arising from men’s wish to expose paradoxical results arising from\nan opponent’s view, in order that they may be admired when they suc-\nceed, is one that puts us in a difficulty (for thought is bound fast when it\nwill not rest because the conclusion does not satisfy it, and cannot ad-\nvance because it cannot refute the argument). There is an argument\nfrom which it follows that folly coupled with incontinence is virtue; for\na man does the opposite of what he judges, owing to incontinence, but\njudges what is good to be evil and something that he should not do, and\nconsequence he will do what is good and not what is evil.\n(5) Further, he who on conviction does and pursues and chooses\nwhat is pleasant would be thought to be better than one who does so as\na result not of calculation but of incontinence; for he is easier to cure\nsince he may be persuaded to change his mind. But to the incontinent\nman may be applied the proverb ‘when water chokes, what is one to\nwash it down with?’ If he had been persuaded of the rightness of what\nhe does, he would have desisted when he was persuaded to change his\nmind; but now he acts in spite of his being persuaded of something quite\ndifferent.\n(6) Further, if incontinence and continence are concerned with any\nand every kind of object, who is it that is incontinent in the unqualified\nsense? No one has all the forms of incontinence, but we say some people\nare incontinent without qualification.",

    "text": "Of some such kind are the difficulties that arise; some of these points\nmust be refuted and the others left in possession of the field; for the\nsolution of the difficulty is the discovery of the truth. (1) We must con-\nsider first, then, whether incontinent people act knowingly or not, and in\nwhat sense knowingly; then (2) with what sorts of object the incontinent\nand the continent man may be said to be concerned (i.e., whether with\nany and every pleasure and pain or with certain determinate kinds), and\nwhether the continent man and the man of endurance are the same or\ndifferent; and similarly with regard to the other matters germane to this\ninquiry. The starting-point of our investigation is (a) the question whether\nthe continent man and the incontinent are differentiated by their objects\nor by their attitude, i.e., whether the incontinent man is incontinent sim-\nply by being concerned with such and such objects, or, instead, by his\nattitude, or, instead of that, by both these things; (b) the second question\nis whether incontinence and continence are concerned with any and ev-\nery object or not. The man who is incontinent in the unqualified sense is\nneither concerned with any and every object, but with precisely those\nwith which the self-indulgent man is concerned, nor is he characterized\nby being simply related to these (for then his state would be the same as\nself-indulgence), but by being related to them in a certain way. For the\none is led on in accordance with his own choice, thinking that he ought\nalways to pursue the present pleasure; while the other does not think so,\nbut yet pursues it.\n(1) As for the suggestion that it is true opinion and not knowledge\nagainst which we act incontinently, that makes no difference to the argu-\nment; for some people when in a state of opinion do not hesitate, but\nthink they know exactly. If, then, the notion is that owing to their weak\nconviction those who have opinion are more likely to act against their\njudgement than those who know, we answer that there need be no differ-\nence between knowledge and opinion in this respect; for some men are\nno less convinced of what they think than others of what they know; as\nis shown by the of Heraclitus. But (a), since we use the word ‘know’ in\ntwo senses (for both the man who has knowledge but is not using it and\nhe who is using it are said to know), it will make a difference whether,\nwhen a man does what he should not, he has the knowledge but is not\nexercising it, or is exercising it; for the latter seems strange, but not the\nformer.\n(b) Further, since there are two kinds of premisses, there is nothing\nto prevent a man’s having both premisses and acting against his knowl-\nedge, provided that he is using only the universal premiss and not the\nparticular; for it is particular acts that have to be done. And there are\nalso two kinds of universal term; one is predicable of the agent, the\nother of the object; e.g., ‘dry food is good for every man,’ and ‘I am a\nman,’ or ‘such and such food is dry’; but whether ‘this food is such and\nsuch,’ of this the incontinent man either has not or is not exercising the\nknowledge. There will, then, be, firstly, an enormous difference between\nthese manners of knowing, so that to know in one way when we act\nincontinently would not seem anything strange, while to know in the\nother way would be extraordinary.\nAnd further (c) the possession of knowledge in another sense than\nthose just named is something that happens to men; for within the case\nof having knowledge but not using it we see a difference of state, admit-\nting of the possibility of having knowledge in a sense and yet not having\nit, as in the instance of a man asleep, mad, or drunk. But now this is just\nthe condition of men under the influence of passions; for outbursts of\nanger and sexual appetites and some other such passions, it is evident,\nactually alter our bodily condition, and in some men even produce fits\nof madness. It is plain, then, that incontinent people must be said to be\nin a similar condition to men asleep, mad, or drunk. The fact that men\nuse the language that flows from knowledge proves nothing; for even\nmen under the influence of these passions utter scientific proofs and\nverses of Empedocles, and those who have just begun to learn a science\ncan string together its phrases, but do not yet know it; for it has to\nbecome part of themselves, and that takes time; so that we must suppose\nthat the use of language by men in an incontinent state means no more\nthan its utterance by actors on the stage. (d) Again, we may also view\nthe cause as follows with reference to the facts of human nature. The\none opinion is universal, the other is concerned with the particular facts,\nand here we come to something within the sphere of perception; when a\nsingle opinion results from the two, the soul must in one type of case\naffirm the conclusion, while in the case of opinions concerned with pro-\nduction it must immediately act (e.g., if ‘everything sweet ought to be\ntasted,’ and ‘this is sweet,’ in the sense of being one of the particular\nsweet things, the man who can act and is not prevented must at the same\ntime actually act accordingly). When, then, the universal opinion is\npresent in us forbidding us to taste, and there is also the opinion that\n‘everything sweet is pleasant,’ and that ‘this is sweet’ (now this is the\nopinion that is active), and when appetite happens to be present in us,\nthe one opinion bids us avoid the object, but appetite leads us towards it\n(for it can move each of our bodily parts); so that it turns out that a man\nbehaves incontinently under the influence (in a sense) of a rule and an\nopinion, and of one not contrary in itself, but only incidentally—for the\nappetite is contrary, not the opinion—to the right rule. It also follows\nthat this is the reason why the lower animals are not incontinent, viz.,\nbecause they have no universal judgement but only imagination and\nmemory of particulars.\nThe explanation of how the ignorance is dissolved and the inconti-\nnent man regains his knowledge, is the same as in the case of the man\ndrunk or asleep and is not peculiar to this condition; we must go to the\nstudents of natural science for it. Now, the last premiss both being an\nopinion about a perceptible object, and being what determines our ac-\ntions this a man either has not when he is in the state of passion, or has\nit in the sense in which having knowledge did not mean knowing but\nonly talking, as a drunken man may utter the verses of Empedocles. And\nbecause the last term is not universal nor equally an object of scientific\nknowledge with the universal term, the position that Socrates sought to\nestablish actually seems to result; for it is not in the presence of what is\nthought to be knowledge proper that the affection of incontinence arises\n(nor is it this that is ‘dragged about’ as a result of the state of passion),\nbut in that of perceptual knowledge.\nThis must suffice as our answer to the question of action with and\nwithout knowledge, and how it is possible to behave incontinently with\nknowledge.",

    "text": "(2) We must next discuss whether there is any one who is incontinent\nwithout qualification, or all men who are incontinent are so in a particu-\nlar sense, and if there is, with what sort of objects he is concerned. That\nboth continent persons and persons of endurance, and incontinent and\nsoft persons, are concerned with pleasures and pains, is evident.\nNow of the things that produce pleasure some are necessary, while\nothers are worthy of choice in themselves but admit of excess, the bodily\ncauses of pleasure being necessary (by such I mean both those con-\ncerned with food and those concerned with sexual intercourse, i.e., the\nbodily matters with which we defined self-indulgence and temperance\nas being concerned), while the others are not necessary but worthy of\nchoice in themselves (e.g., victory, honour, wealth, and good and pleas-\nant things of this sort). This being so, (a) those who go to excess with\nreference to the latter, contrary to the right rule which is in themselves,\nare not called incontinent simply, but incontinent with the qualification\n‘in respect of money, gain, honour, or anger,’—not simply incontinent,\non the ground that they are different from incontinent people and are\ncalled incontinent by reason of a resemblance. (Compare the case of\nAnthropos (Man), who won a contest at the Olympic games; in his case\nthe general definition of man differed little from the definition peculiar\nto him, but yet it was different.) This is shown by the fact that inconti-\nnence either without qualification or in respect of some particular bodily\npleasure is blamed not only as a fault but as a kind of vice, while none of\nthe people who are incontinent in these other respects is so blamed.\nBut (b) of the people who are incontinent with respect to bodily\nenjoyments, with which we say the temperate and the self-indulgent man\nare concerned, he who pursues the excesses of things pleasant—and\nshuns those of things painful, of hunger and thirst and heat and cold and\nall the objects of touch and taste—not by choice but contrary to his\nchoice and his judgement, is called incontinent, not with the qualifica-\ntion ‘in respect of this or that,’ e.g., of anger, but just simply. This is\nconfirmed by the fact that men are called ‘soft’ with regard to these\npleasures, but not with regard to any of the others. And for this reason\nwe group together the incontinent and the self-indulgent, the continent\nand the temperate man—but not any of these other types—because they\nare concerned somehow with the same pleasures and pains; but though\nthese are concerned with the same objects, they are not similarly related\nto them, but some of them make a deliberate choice while the others do\nnot.\nThis is why we should describe as self-indulgent rather the man\nwho without appetite or with but a slight appetite pursues the excesses\nof pleasure and avoids moderate pains, than the man who does so be-\ncause of his strong appetites; for what would the former do, if he had in\naddition a vigorous appetite, and a violent pain at the lack of the ‘neces-\nsary’ objects?\nNow of appetites and pleasures some belong to the class of things\ngenerically noble and good-for some pleasant things are by nature wor-\nthy of choice, while others are contrary to these, and others are interme-\ndiate, to adopt our previous distinction—e.g., wealth, gain, victory,\nhonour. And with reference to all objects whether of this or of the inter-\nmediate kind men are not blamed for being affected by them, for desir-\ning and loving them, but for doing so in a certain way, i.e., for going to\nexcess. (This is why all those who contrary to the rule either are mas-\ntered by or pursue one of the objects which are naturally noble and\ngood, e.g., those who busy themselves more than they ought about honour\nor about children and parents, (are not wicked); for these too are good,\nand those who busy themselves about them are praised; but yet there is\nan excess even in them—if like Niobe one were to fight even against the\ngods, or were to be as much devoted to one’s father as Satyrus nick-\nnamed ‘the filial,’ who was thought to be very silly on this point.) There\nis no wickedness, then, with regard to these objects, for the reason named,\nviz., because each of them is by nature a thing worthy of choice for its\nown sake; yet excesses in respect of them are bad and to be avoided.\nSimilarly there is no incontinence with regard to them; for incontinence\nis not only to be avoided but is also a thing worthy of blame; but owing\nto a similarity in the state of feeling people apply the name incontinence,\nadding in each case what it is in respect of, as we may describe as a bad\ndoctor or a bad actor one whom we should not call bad, simply. As,\nthen, in this case we do not apply the term without qualification because\neach of these conditions is no shadness but only analogous to it, so it is\nclear that in the other case also that alone must be taken to be inconti-\nnence and continence which is concerned with the same objects as tem-\nperance and self-indulgence, but we apply the term to anger by virtue of\na resemblance; and this is why we say with a qualification ‘incontinent\nin respect of anger’ as we say ‘incontinent in respect of honour, or of\ngain.’",

    "text": "(1) Some things are pleasant by nature, and of these (a) some are so\nwithout qualification, and (b) others are so with reference to particular\nclasses either of animals or of men; while (2) others are not pleasant by\nnature, but (a) some of them become so by reason of injuries to the\nsystem, and (b) others by reason of acquired habits, and (c) others by\nreason of originally bad natures. This being so, it is possible with regard\nto each of the latter kinds to discover similar states of character to those\nrecognized with regard to the former; I mean (A) the brutish states, as in\nthe case of the female who, they say, rips open pregnant women and\ndevours the infants, or of the things in which some of the tribes about\nthe Black Sea that have gone savage are said to delight—in raw meat or\nin human flesh, or in lending their children to one another to feast upon—\nor of the story told of Phalaris.\nThese states are brutish, but (B) others arise as a result of disease\n(or, in some cases, of madness, as with the man who sacrificed and ate\nhis mother, or with the slave who ate the liver of his fellow), and others\nare morbid states (C) resulting from custom, e.g., the habit of plucking\nout the hair or of gnawing the nails, or even coals or earth, and in addi-\ntion to these paederasty; for these arise in some by nature and in others,\nas in those who have been the victims of lust from childhood, from\nhabit.\nNow those in whom nature is the cause of such a state no one would\ncall incontinent, any more than one would apply the epithet to women\nbecause of the passive part they play in copulation; nor would one apply\nit to those who are in a morbid condition as a result of habit. To have\nthese various types of habit is beyond the limits of vice, as brutishness is\ntoo; for a man who has them to master or be mastered by them is not\nsimple (continence or) incontinence but that which is so by analogy, as\nthe man who is in this condition in respect of fits of anger is to be called\nincontinent in respect of that feeling but not incontinent simply. For\nevery excessive state whether of folly, of cowardice, of self-indulgence,\nor of bad temper, is either brutish or morbid; the man who is by nature\napt to fear everything, even the squeak of a mouse, is cowardly with a\nbrutish cowardice, while the man who feared a weasel did so in conse-\nquence of disease; and of foolish people those who by nature are thought-\nless and live by their senses alone are brutish, like some races of the\ndistant barbarians, while those who are so as a result of disease (e.g., of\nepilepsy) or of madness are morbid. Of these characteristics it is pos-\nsible to have some only at times, and not to be mastered by them. e.g.,\nPhalaris may have restrained a desire to eat the flesh of a child or an\nappetite for unnatural sexual pleasure; but it is also possible to be mas-\ntered, not merely to have the feelings. Thus, as the wickedness which is\non the human level is called wickedness simply, while that which is not\nis called wickedness not simply but with the qualification ‘brutish’ or\n‘morbid,’ in the same way it is plain that some incontinence is brutish\nand some morbid, while only that which corresponds to human self-\nindulgence is incontinence simply.\nThat incontinence and continence, then, are concerned only with the\nsame objects as selfindulgence and temperance and that what is con-\ncerned with other objects is a type distinct from incontinence, and called\nincontinence by a metaphor and not simply, is plain.",

    "text": "That incontinence in respect of anger is less disgraceful than that in\nrespect of the appetites is what we will now proceed to see. (1) Anger\nseems to listen to argument to some extent, but to mishear it, as do hasty\nservants who run out before they have heard the whole of what one\nsays, and then muddle the order, or as dogs bark if there is but a knock\nat the door, before looking to see if it is a friend; so anger by reason of\nthe warmth and hastiness of its nature, though it hears, does not hear an\norder, and springs to take revenge. For argument or imagination in-\nforms us that we have been insulted or slighted, and anger, reasoning as\nit were that anything like this must be fought against, boils up straight-\nway; while appetite, if argument or perception merely says that an ob-\nject is pleasant, springs to the enjoyment of it. Therefore anger obeys\nthe argument in a sense, but appetite does not. It is therefore more dis-\ngraceful; for the man who is incontinent in respect of anger is in a sense\nconquered by argument, while the other is conquered by appetite and\nnot by argument.\n(2) Further, we pardon people more easily for following natural\ndesires, since we pardon them more easily for following such appetites\nas are common to all men, and in so far as they are common; now anger\nand bad temper are more natural than the appetites for excess, i.e., for\nunnecessary objects. Take for instance the man who defended himself\non the charge of striking his father by saying ‘yes, but he struck his\nfather, and he struck his, and’ (pointing to his child) ‘this boy will strike\nme when he is a man; it runs in the family’; or the man who when he was\nbeing dragged along by his son bade him stop at the doorway, since he\nhimself had dragged his father only as far as that.\n(2) Further, those who are more given to plotting against others are\nmore criminal. Now a passionate man is not given to plotting, nor is\nanger itself—it is open; but the nature of appetite is illustrated by what\nthe poets call Aphrodite, ‘guile-weaving daughter of Cyprus,’ and by\nHomer’s words about her ‘embroidered girdle’:\nAnd the whisper of wooing is there, Whose subtlety stealeth the wits of\nthe wise, how prudent soe’er.\nTherefore if this form of incontinence is more criminal and dis-\ngraceful than that in respect of anger, it is both incontinence without\nqualification and in a sense vice.\n(4) Further, no one commits wanton outrage with a feeling of pain,\nbut every one who acts in anger acts with pain, while the man who\ncommits outrage acts with pleasure. If, then, those acts at which it is\nmost just to be angry are more criminal than others, the incontinence\nwhich is due to appetite is the more criminal; for there is no wanton\noutrage involved in anger.\nPlainly, then, the incontinence concerned with appetite is more dis-\ngraceful than that concerned with anger, and continence and inconti-\nnence are concerned with bodily appetites and pleasures; but we must\ngrasp the differences among the latter themselves. For, as has been said\nat the beginning, some are human and natural both in kind and in mag-\nnitude, others are brutish, and others are due to organic injuries and\ndiseases. Only with the first of these are temperance and self-indulgence\nconcerned; this is why we call the lower animals neither temperate nor\nself-indulgent except by a metaphor, and only if some one race of ani-\nmals exceeds another as a whole in wantonness, destructiveness, and\nomnivorous greed; these have no power of choice or calculation, but\nthey are departures from the natural norm, as, among men, madmen\nare. Now brutishness is a less evil than vice, though more alarming; for\nit is not that the better part has been perverted, as in man,—they have no\nbetter part. Thus it is like comparing a lifeless thing with a living in\nrespect of badness; for the badness of that which has no originative\nsource of movement is always less hurtful, and reason is an originative\nsource. Thus it is like comparing injustice in the abstract with an unjust\nman. Each is in some sense worse; for a bad man will do ten thousand\ntimes as much evil as a brute.",

    "text": "With regard to the pleasures and pains and appetites and aversions aris-\ning through touch and taste, to which both self-indulgence and temper-\nance were formerly narrowed down, it possible to be in such a state as\nto be defeated even by those of them which most people master, or to\nmaster even those by which most people are defeated; among these possi-\nbilities, those relating to pleasures are incontinence and continence, those\nrelating to pains softness and endurance. The state of most people is\nintermediate, even if they lean more towards the worse states.\nNow, since some pleasures are necessary while others are not, and\nare necessary up to a point while the excesses of them are not, nor the\ndeficiencies, and this is equally true of appetites and pains, the man who\npursues the excesses of things pleasant, or pursues to excess necessary\nobjects, and does so by choice, for their own sake and not at all for the\nsake of any result distinct from them, is self-indulgent; for such a man is\nof necessity unlikely to repent, and therefore incurable, since a man who\ncannot repent cannot be cured. The man who is deficient in his pursuit\nof them is the opposite of self-indulgent; the man who is intermediate is\ntemperate. Similarly, there is the man who avoids bodily pains not be-\ncause he is defeated by them but by choice. (Of those who do not choose\nsuch acts, one kind of man is led to them as a result of the pleasure\ninvolved, another because he avoids the pain arising from the appetite,\nso that these types differ from one another. Now any one would think\nworse of a man with no appetite or with weak appetite were he to do\nsomething disgraceful, than if he did it under the influence of powerful\nappetite, and worse of him if he struck a blow not in anger than if he did\nit in anger; for what would he have done if he had been strongly af-\nfected? This is why the self-indulgent man is worse than the inconti-\nnent.) of the states named, then, the latter is rather a kind of softness; the\nformer is self-indulgence. While to the incontinent man is opposed the\ncontinent, to the soft is opposed the man of endurance; for endurance\nconsists in resisting, while continence consists in conquering, and re-\nsisting and conquering are different, as not being beaten is different\nfrom winning; this is why continence is also more worthy of choice than\nendurance. Now the man who is defective in respect of resistance to the\nthings which most men both resist and resist successfully is soft and\neffeminate; for effeminacy too is a kind of softness; such a man trails\nhis cloak to avoid the pain of lifting it, and plays the invalid without\nthinking himself wretched, though the man he imitates is a wretched\nman.\nThe case is similar with regard to continence and incontinence. For\nif a man is defeated by violent and excessive pleasures or pains, there is\nnothing wonderful in that; indeed we are ready to pardon him if he has\nresisted, as Theodectes’ Philoctetes does when bitten by the snake, or\nCarcinus’ Cercyon in the Alope, and as people who try to restrain their\nlaughter burst out into a guffaw, as happened to Xenophantus. But it is\nsurprising if a man is defeated by and cannot resist pleasures or pains\nwhich most men can hold out against, when this is not due to heredity or\ndisease, like the softness that is hereditary with the kings of the Scythians,\nor that which distinguishes the female sex from the male.\nThe lover of amusement, too, is thought to be self-indulgent, but is\nreally soft. For amusement is a relaxation, since it is a rest from work;\nand the lover of amusement is one of the people who go to excess in this.\nOf incontinence one kind is impetuosity, another weakness. For some\nmen after deliberating fail, owing to their emotion, to stand by the con-\nclusions of their deliberation, others because they have not deliberated\nare led by their emotion; since some men (just as people who first tickle\nothers are not tickled themselves), if they have first perceived and seen\nwhat is coming and have first roused themselves and their calculative\nfaculty, are not defeated by their emotion, whether it be pleasant or\npainful. It is keen and excitable people that suffer especially from the\nimpetuous form of incontinence; for the former by reason of their quick-\nness and the latter by reason of the violence of their passions do not\nawait the argument, because they are apt to follow their imagination.",

This is why the\nposition is not as it was expressed in the formulation of the problem, but\nthe self-indulgent man is incurable and the incontinent man curable; for\nwickedness is like a disease such as dropsy or consumption, while in-\ncontinence is like epilepsy; the former is a permanent, the latter an inter-\nmittent badness. And generally incontinence and vice are different in\nkind; vice is unconscious of itself, incontinence is not (of incontinent\nmen themselves, those who become temporarily beside themselves are\nbetter than those who have the rational principle but do not abide by it,\nsince the latter are defeated by a weaker passion, and do not act without\nprevious deliberation like the others); for the incontinent man is like the\npeople who get drunk quickly and on little wine, i.e., on less than most\npeople.\nEvidently, then, incontinence is not vice (though perhaps it is so in a\nqualified sense); for incontinence is contrary to choice while vice is in\naccordance with choice; not but what they are similar in respect of the\nactions they lead to; as in the saying of Demodocus about the Milesians,\n‘the Milesians are not without sense, but they do the things that sense-\nless people do,’ so too incontinent people are not criminal, but they will\ndo criminal acts.\nNow, since the incontinent man is apt to pursue, not on conviction,\nbodily pleasures that are excessive and contrary to the right rule, while\nthe self-indulgent man is convinced because he is the sort of man to\npursue them, it is on the contrary the former that is easily persuaded to\nchange his mind, while the latter is not. For virtue and vice respectively\npreserve and destroy the first principle, and in actions the final cause is\nthe first principle, as the hypotheses are in mathematics; neither in that\ncase is it argument that teaches the first principles, nor is it so here-\nvirtue either natural or produced by habituation is what teaches right\nopinion about the first principle. Such a man as this, then, is temperate;\nhis contrary is the self-indulgent.\nBut there is a sort of man who is carried away as a result of passion\nand contrary to the right rule—a man whom passion masters so that he\ndoes not act according to the right rule, but does not master to the extent\nof making him ready to believe that he ought to pursue such pleasures\nwithout reserve; this is the incontinent man, who is better than the self-\nindulgent man, and not bad without qualification; for the best thing in\nhim, the first principle, is preserved. And contrary to him is another\nkind of man, he who abides by his convictions and is not carried away,\nat least as a result of passion. It is evident from these considerations that\nthe latter is a good state and the former a bad one.",

    "text": "Is the man continent who abides by any and every rule and any and\nevery choice, or the man who abides by the right choice, and is he incon-\ntinent who abandons any and every choice and any and every rule, or he\nwho abandons the rule that is not false and the choice that is right; this\nis how we put it before in our statement of the problem. Or is it inciden-\ntally any and every choice but per se the true rule and the right choice by\nwhich the one abides and the other does not? If any one chooses or\npursues this for the sake of that, per se he pursues and chooses the latter,\nbut incidentally the former. But when we speak without qualification we\nmean what is per se. Therefore in a sense the one abides by, and the\nother abandons, any and every opinion; but without qualification, the\ntrue opinion.\nThere are some who are apt to abide by their opinion, who are called\nstrong-headed, viz. those who are hard to persuade in the first instance\nand are not easily persuaded to change; these have in them something\nlike the continent man, as the prodigal is in a way like the liberal man\nand the rash man like the confident man; but they are different in many\nrespects. For it is to passion and appetite that the one will not yield,\nsince on occasion the continent man will be easy to persuade; but it is to\nargument that the others refuse to yield, for they do form appetites and\nmany of them are led by their pleasures. Now the people who are strong-\nheaded are the opinionated, the ignorant, and the boorish—the opinion-\nated being influenced by pleasure and pain; for they delight in the vic-\ntory they gain if they are not persuaded to change, and are pained if their\ndecisions become null and void as decrees sometimes do; so that they\nare liker the incontinent than the continent man.\nBut there are some who fail to abide by their resolutions, not as a\nresult of incontinence, e.g., Neoptolemus in Sophocles’ Philoctetes; yet\nit was for the sake of pleasure that he did not stand fast—but a noble\npleasure; for telling the truth was noble to him, but he had been per-\nsuaded by Odysseus to tell the lie. For not every one who does anything\nfor the sake of pleasure is either self-indulgent or bad or incontinent, but\nhe who does it for a disgraceful pleasure.\nSince there is also a sort of man who takes less delight than he\nshould in bodily things, and does not abide by the rule, he who is inter-\nmediate between him and the incontinent man is the continent man; for\nthe incontinent man fails to abide by the rule because he delights too\nmuch in them, and this man because he delights in them too little; while\nthe continent man abides by the rule and does not change on either ac-\ncount. Now if continence is good, both the contrary states must be bad,\nas they actually appear to be; but because the other extreme is seen in\nfew people and seldom, as temperance is thought to be contrary only to\nself-indulgence, so is continence to incontinence.\nSince many names are applied analogically, it is by analogy that we\nhave come to speak of the ‘continence’ the temperate man; for both the\ncontinent man and the temperate man are such as to do nothing contrary\nto the rule for the sake of the bodily pleasures, but the former has and\nthe latter has not bad appetites, and the latter is such as not to feel\npleasure contrary to the rule, while the former is such as to feel pleasure\nbut not to be led by it. And the incontinent and the self-indulgent man\nare also like another; they are different, but both pursue bodily plea-\nsures—the latter, however, also thinking that he ought to do so, while\nthe former does not think this.",

    "text": "Nor can the same man have practical wisdom and be incontinent; for it\nhas been shown that a man is at the same time practically wise, and\ngood in respect of character. Further, a man has practical wisdom not\nby knowing only but by being able to act; but the incontinent man is\nunable to act—there is, however, nothing to prevent a clever man from\nbeing incontinent; this is why it is sometimes actually thought that some\npeople have practical wisdom but are incontinent, viz., because clever-\nness and practical wisdom differ in the way we have described in our\nfirst discussions, and are near together in respect of their reasoning, but\ndiffer in respect of their purpose—nor yet is the incontinent man like the\nman who knows and is contemplating a truth, but like the man who is\nasleep or drunk. And he acts willingly (for he acts in a sense with knowl-\nedge both of what he does and of the end to which he does it), but is not\nwicked, since his purpose is good; so that he is half-wicked. And he is\nnot a criminal; for he does not act of malice aforethought; of the two\ntypes of incontinent man the one does not abide by the conclusions of\nhis deliberation, while the excitable man does not deliberate at all. And\nthus the incontinent man like a city which passes all the right decrees\nand has good laws, but makes no use of them, as in Anaxandrides’\njesting remark,\nThe city willed it, that cares nought for laws; but the wicked man is\nlike a city that uses its laws, but has wicked laws to use.\nNow incontinence and continence are concerned with that which is\nin excess of the state characteristic of most men; for the continent man\nabides by his resolutions more and the incontinent man less than most\nmen can.\nOf the forms of incontinence, that of excitable people is more cur-\nable than that of those who deliberate but do not abide by their deci-\nsions, and those who are incontinent through habituation are more cur-\nable than those in whom incontinence is innate; for it is easier to change\na habit than to change one’s nature; even habit is hard to change just\nbecause it is like nature, as Evenus says:\nI say that habit’s but a long practice, friend,\nAnd this becomes men’s nature in the end.\nWe have now stated what continence, incontinence, endurance, and\nsoftness are, and how these states are related to each other.",

    "text": "The study of pleasure and pain belongs to the province of the political\nphilosopher; for he is the architect of the end, with a view to which we\ncall one thing bad and another good without qualification. Further, it is\none of our necessary tasks to consider them; for not only did we lay it\ndown that moral virtue and vice are concerned with pains and pleasures,\nbut most people say that happiness involves pleasure; this is why the\nblessed man is called by a name derived from a word meaning enjoy-\nment.\nNow (1) some people think that no pleasure is a good, either in itself\nor incidentally, since the good and pleasure are not the same; (2) others\nthink that some pleasures are good but that most are bad. (3) Again\nthere is a third view, that even if all pleasures are good, yet the best thing\nin the world cannot be pleasure. (1) The reasons given for the view that\npleasure is not a good at all are (a) that every pleasure is a perceptible\nprocess to a natural state, and that no process is of the same kind as its\nend, e.g., no process of building of the same kind as a house. (b) A\ntemperate man avoids pleasures. (c) A man of practical wisdom pur-\nsues what is free from pain, not what is pleasant. (d) The pleasures are\na hindrance to thought, and the more so the more one delights in them,\ne.g., in sexual pleasure; for no one could think of anything while ab-\nsorbed in this. (e) There is no art of pleasure; but every good is the\nproduct of some art. (f) Children and the brutes pursue pleasures. (2)\nThe reasons for the view that not all pleasures are good are that (a) there\nare pleasures that are actually base and objects of reproach, and (b)\nthere are harmful pleasures; for some pleasant things are unhealthy. (3)\nThe reason for the view that the best thing in the world is not pleasure is\nthat pleasure is not an end but a process.",

    "text": "These are pretty much the things that are said. That it does not follow\nfrom these grounds that pleasure is not a good, or even the chief good, is\nplain from the following considerations. (A, a) First, since that which is\ngood may be so in either of two senses (one thing good simply and\nanother good for a particular person), natural constitutions and states of\nbeing, and therefore also the corresponding movements and processes,\nwill be correspondingly divisible. Of those which are thought to be bad\nsome will be bad if taken without qualification but not bad for a particu-\nlar person, but worthy of his choice, and some will not be worthy of\nchoice even for a particular person, but only at a particular time and for\na short period, though not without qualification; while others are not\neven pleasures, but seem to be so, viz. all those which involve pain and\nwhose end is curative, e.g., the processes that go on in sick persons.\n(b) Further, one kind of good being activity and another being state,\nthe processes that restore us to our natural state are only incidentally\npleasant; for that matter the activity at work in the appetites for them is\nthe activity of so much of our state and nature as has remained unim-\npaired; for there are actually pleasures that involve no pain or appetite\n(e.g., those of contemplation), the nature in such a case not being defec-\ntive at all. That the others are incidental is indicated by the fact that men\ndo not enjoy the same pleasant objects when their nature is in its settled\nstate as they do when it is being replenished, but in the former case they\nenjoy the things that are pleasant without qualification, in the latter the\ncontraries of these as well; for then they enjoy even sharp and bitter\nthings, none of which is pleasant either by nature or without qualifica-\ntion. The states they produce, therefore, are not pleasures naturally or\nwithout qualification; for as pleasant things differ, so do the pleasures\narising from them.\n(c) Again, it is not necessary that there should be something else\nbetter than pleasure, as some say the end is better than the process; for\nleasures are not processes nor do they all involve process—they are\nactivities and ends; nor do they arise when we are becoming something,\nbut when we are exercising some faculty; and not all pleasures have an\nend different from themselves, but only the pleasures of persons who\nare being led to the perfecting of their nature. This is why it is not right\nto say that pleasure is perceptible process, but it should rather be called\nactivity of the natural state, and instead of ‘perceptible’ ‘unimpeded.’ It\nis thought by some people to be process just because they think it is in\nthe strict sense good; for they think that activity is process, which it is\nnot.\n(B) The view that pleasures are bad because some pleasant things\nare unhealthy is like saying that healthy things are bad because some\nhealthy things are bad for money-making; both are bad in the respect\nmentioned, but they are not bad for that reason-indeed, thinking itself is\nsometimes injurious to health.\nNeither practical wisdom nor any state of being is impeded by the\npleasure arising from it; it is foreign pleasures that impede, for the plea-\nsures arising from thinking and learning will make us think and learn all\nthe more.\n(C) The fact that no pleasure is the product of any art arises natu-\nrally enough; there is no art of any other activity either, but only of the\ncorresponding faculty; though for that matter the arts of the perfumer\nand the cook are thought to be arts of pleasure.\n(D) The arguments based on the grounds that the temperate man\navoids pleasure and that the man of practical wisdom pursues the pain-\nless life, and that children and the brutes pursue pleasure, are all refuted\nby the same consideration. We have pointed out in what sense pleasures\nare good without qualification and in what sense some are not good;\nnow both the brutes and children pursue pleasures of the latter kind (and\nthe man of practical wisdom pursues tranquil freedom from that kind),\nviz., those which imply appetite and pain, i.e., the bodily pleasures (for\nit is these that are of this nature) and the excesses of them, in respect of\nwhich the self-indulgent man is self-indulent. This is why the temperate\nman avoids these pleasures; for even he has pleasures of his own.",

    "text": "But further (E) it is agreed that pain is bad and to be avoided; for some\npain is without qualification bad, and other pain is bad because it is in\nsome respect an impediment to us. Now the contrary of that which is to\nbe avoided, qua something to be avoided and bad, is good. Pleasure,\nthen, is necessarily a good. For the answer of Speusippus, that pleasure\nis contrary both to pain and to good, as the greater is contrary both to\nthe less and to the equal, is not successful; since he would not say that\npleasure is essentially just a species of evil.\nAnd (F) if certain pleasures are bad, that does not prevent the chief\ngood from being some pleasure, just as the chief good may be some\nform of knowledge though certain kinds of knowledge are bad. Perhaps\nit is even necessary, if each disposition has unimpeded activities, that,\nwhether the activity (if unimpeded) of all our dispositions or that of\nsome one of them is happiness, this should be the thing most worthy of\nour choice; and this activity is pleasure. Thus the chief good would be\nsome pleasure, though most pleasures might perhaps be bad without\nqualification. And for this reason all men think that the happy life is\npleasant and weave pleasure into their ideal of happiness-and reason-\nably too; for no activity is perfect when it is impeded, and happiness is\na perfect thing; this is why the happy man needs the goods of the body\nand external goods, i.e., those of fortune, viz. in order that he may not\nbe impeded in these ways. Those who say that the victim on the rack or\nthe man who falls into great misfortunes is happy if he is good, are,\nwhether they mean to or not, talking nonsense. Now because we need\nfortune as well as other things, some people think good fortune the same\nthing as happiness; but it is not that, for even good fortune itself when in\nexcess is an impediment, and perhaps should then be no longer called\ngood fortune; for its limit is fixed by reference to happiness.\nAnd indeed the fact that all things, both brutes and men, pursue\npleasure is an indication of its being somehow the chief good:\nNo voice is wholly lost that many peoples... But since no one nature\nor state either is or is thought the best for all, neither do all pursue the\nsame pleasure; yet all pursue pleasure. And perhaps they actually pur-\nsue not the pleasure they think they pursue nor that which they would\nsay they pursue, but the same pleasure; for all things have by nature\nsomething divine in them. But the bodily pleasures have appropriated\nthe name both because we oftenest steer our course for them and be-\ncause all men share in them; thus because they alone are familiar, men\nthink there are no others.\nIt is evident also that if pleasure, i.e., the activity of our faculties, is\nnot a good, it will not be the case that the happy man lives a pleasant\nlife; for to what end should he need pleasure, if it is not a good but the\nhappy man may even live a painful life? For pain is neither an evil nor a\ngood, if pleasure is not; why then should he avoid it? Therefore, too, the\nlife of the good man will not be pleasanter than that of any one else, if\nhis activities are not more pleasant.",

    "text": "(G) With regard to the bodily pleasures, those who say that some plea-\nsures are very much to be chosen, viz. the noble pleasures, but not the\nbodily pleasures, i.e., those with which the self-indulgent man is con-\ncerned, must consider why, then, the contrary pains are bad. For the\ncontrary of bad is good. Are the necessary pleasures good in the sense in\nwhich even that which is not bad is good? Or are they good up to a\npoint? Is it that where you have states and processes of which there\ncannot be too much, there cannot be too much of the corresponding\npleasure, and that where there can be too much of the one there can be\ntoo much of the other also? Now there can be too much of bodily goods,\nand the bad man is bad by virtue of pursuing the excess, not by virtue of\npursuing the necessary pleasures (for all men enjoy in some way or\nother both dainty foods and wines and sexual intercourse, but not all\nmen do so as they ought). The contrary is the case with pain; for he does\nnot avoid the excess of it, he avoids it altogether; and this is peculiar to\nhim, for the alternative to excess of pleasure is not pain, except to the\nman who pursues this excess.\nSince we should state not only the truth, but also the cause of er-\nror—for this contributes towards producing conviction, since when a\nreasonable explanation is given of why the false view appears true, this\ntends to produce belief in the true view—therefore we must state why\nthe bodily pleasures appear the more worthy of choice. (a) Firstly, then,\nit is because they expel pain; owing to the excesses of pain that men\nexperience, they pursue excessive and in general bodily pleasure as be-\ning a cure for the pain. Now curative agencies produce intense feeling—\nwhich is the reason why they are pursued—because they show up against\nthe contrary pain. (Indeed pleasure is thought not to be good for these\ntwo reasons, as has been said, viz., that (a) some of them are activities\nbelonging to a bad nature—either congenital, as in the case of a brute,\nor due to habit, i.e., those of bad men; while (b) others are meant to cure\na defective nature, and it is better to be in a healthy state than to be\ngetting into it, but these arise during the process of being made perfect\nand are therefore only incidentally good., b) Further, they are pursued\nbecause of their violence by those who cannot enjoy other pleasures. (At\nall events they go out of their way to manufacture thirsts somehow for\nthemselves. When these are harmless, the practice is irreproachable;\nwhen they are hurtful, it is bad.) For they have nothing else to enjoy,\nand, besides, a neutral state is painful to many people because of their\nnature. For the animal nature is always in travail, as the students of\nnatural science also testify, saying that sight and hearing are painful;\nbut we have become used to this, as they maintain. Similarly, while, in\nyouth, people are, owing to the growth that is going on, in a situation\nlike that of drunken men, and youth is pleasant, on the other hand people\nof excitable nature always need relief; for even their body is ever in\ntorment owing to its special composition, and they are always under the\ninfluence of violent desire; but pain is driven out both by the contrary\npleasure, and by any chance pleasure if it be strong; and for these rea-\nsons they become self-indulgent and bad. But the pleasures that do not\ninvolve pains do not admit of excess; and these are among the things\npleasant by nature and not incidentally. By things pleasant incidentally\nI mean those that act as cures (for because as a result people are cured,\nthrough some action of the part that remains healthy, for this reason the\nprocess is thought pleasant); by things naturally pleasant I mean those\nthat stimulate the action of the healthy nature.\nThere is no one thing that is always pleasant, because our nature is\nnot simple but there is another element in us as well, inasmuch as we are\nperishable creatures, so that if the one element does something, this is\nunnatural to the other nature, and when the two elements are evenly\nbalanced, what is done seems neither painful nor pleasant; for if the\nnature of anything were simple, the same action would always be most\npleasant to it. This is why God always enjoys a single and simple plea-\nsure; for there is not only an activity of movement but an activity of\nimmobility, and pleasure is found more in rest than in movement. But\n‘change in all things is sweet,’ as the poet says, because of some vice;\nfor as it is the vicious man that is changeable, so the nature that needs\nchange is vicious; for it is not simple nor good.\nWe have now discussed continence and incontinence, and pleasure\nand pain, both what each is and in what sense some of them are good\nand others bad; it remains to speak of friendship.",

    "text": "After what we have said, a discussion of friendship would naturally\nfollow, since it is a virtue or implies virtue, and is besides most neces-\nsary with a view to living. For without friends no one would choose to\nlive, though he had all other goods; even rich men and those in posses-\nsion of office and of dominating power are thought to need friends most\nof all; for what is the use of such prosperity without the opportunity of\nbeneficence, which is exercised chiefly and in its most laudable form\ntowards friends? Or how can prosperity be guarded and preserved with-\nout friends? The greater it is, the more exposed is it to risk. And in\npoverty and in other misfortunes men think friends are the only refuge.\nIt helps the young, too, to keep from error; it aids older people by min-\nistering to their needs and supplementing the activities that are failing\nfrom weakness; those in the prime of life it stimulates to noble actions-\n‘two going together’-for with friends men are more able both to think\nand to act. Again, parent seems by nature to feel it for offspring and\noffspring for parent, not only among men but among birds and among\nmost animals; it is felt mutually by members of the same race, and\nespecially by men, whence we praise lovers of their fellowmen. We may\neven in our travels how near and dear every man is to every other. Friend-\nship seems too to hold states together, and lawgivers to care more for it\nthan for justice; for unanimity seems to be something like friendship,\nand this they aim at most of all, and expel faction as their worst enemy;\nand when men are friends they have no need of justice, while when they\nare just they need friendship as well, and the truest form of justice is\nthought to be a friendly quality.\nBut it is not only necessary but also noble; for we praise those who\nlove their friends, and it is thought to be a fine thing to have many\nfriends; and again we think it is the same people that are good men and\nare friends.\nNot a few things about friendship are matters of debate. Some de-\nfine it as a kind of likeness and say like people are friends, whence come\nthe sayings ‘like to like,’ ‘birds of a feather flock together,’ and so on;\nothers on the contrary say ‘two of a trade never agree.’ On this very\nquestion they inquire for deeper and more physical causes, Euripides\nsaying that ‘parched earth loves the rain, and stately heaven when filled\nwith rain loves to fall to earth,’ and Heraclitus that ‘it is what opposes\nthat helps’ and ‘from different tones comes the fairest tune’ and ‘all\nthings are produced through strife’; while Empedocles, as well as oth-\ners, expresses the opposite view that like aims at like. The physical\nproblems we may leave alone (for they do not belong to the present\ninquiry); let us examine those which are human and involve character\nand feeling, e.g., whether friendship can arise between any two people\nor people cannot be friends if they are wicked, and whether there is one\nspecies of friendship or more than one. Those who think there is only\none because it admits of degrees have relied on an inadequate indica-\ntion; for even things different in species admit of degree. We have dis-\ncussed this matter previously.",

    "text": "The kinds of friendship may perhaps be cleared up if we first come to\nknow the object of love. For not everything seems to be loved but only\nthe lovable, and this is good, pleasant, or useful; but it would seem to be\nthat by which some good or pleasure is produced that is useful, so that\nit is the good and the useful that are lovable as ends. Do men love, then,\nthe good, or what is good for them? These sometimes clash. So too with\nregard to the pleasant. Now it is thought that each loves what is good for\nhimself, and that the good is without qualification lovable, and what is\ngood for each man is lovable for him; but each man loves not what is\ngood for him but what seems good. This however will make no differ-\nence; we shall just have to say that this is ‘that which seems lovable’.\nNow there are three grounds on which people love; of the love of lifeless\nobjects we do not use the word ‘friendship’; for it is not mutual love, nor\nis there a wishing of good to the other (for it would surely be ridiculous\nto wish wine well; if one wishes anything for it, it is that it may keep, so\nthat one may have it oneself); but to a friend we say we ought to wish\nwhat is good for his sake. But to those who thus wish good we ascribe\nonly goodwill, if the wish is not reciprocated; goodwill when it is recip-\nrocal being friendship. Or must we add ‘when it is recognized’? For\nmany people have goodwill to those whom they have not seen but judge\nto be good or useful; and one of these might return this feeling. These\npeople seem to bear goodwill to each other; but how could one call them\nfriends when they do not know their mutual feelings? To be friends,\nthen, the must be mutually recognized as bearing goodwill and wishing\nwell to each other for one of the aforesaid reasons.",

    "text": "Now these reasons differ from each other in kind; so, therefore, do the\ncorresponding forms of love and friendship. There are therefore three\nkinds of friendship, equal in number to the things that are lovable; for\nwith respect to each there is a mutual and recognized love, and those\nwho love each other wish well to each other in that respect in which they\nlove one another. Now those who love each other for their utility do not\nlove each other for themselves but in virtue of some good which they get\nfrom each other. So too with those who love for the sake of pleasure; it\nis not for their character that men love ready-witted people, but because\nthey find them pleasant. Therefore those who love for the sake of utility\nlove for the sake of what is good for themselves, and those who love for\nthe sake of pleasure do so for the sake of what is pleasant to themselves,\nand not in so far as the other is the person loved but in so far as he is\nuseful or pleasant. And thus these friendships are only incidental; for it\nis not as being the man he is that the loved person is loved, but as\nproviding some good or pleasure. Such friendships, then, are easily dis-\nsolved, if the parties do not remain like themselves; for if the one party\nis no longer pleasant or useful the other ceases to love him.\nNow the useful is not permanent but is always changing. Thus when\nthe motive of the friendship is done away, the friendship is dissolved,\ninasmuch as it existed only for the ends in question. This kind of friend-\nship seems to exist chiefly between old people (for at that age people\npursue not the pleasant but the useful) and, of those who are in their\nprime or young, between those who pursue utility. And such people do\nnot live much with each other either; for sometimes they do not even\nfind each other pleasant; therefore they do not need such companionship\nunless they are useful to each other; for they are pleasant to each other\nonly in so far as they rouse in each other hopes of something good to\ncome. Among such friendships people also class the friendship of a host\nand guest. On the other hand the friendship of young people seems to\naim at pleasure; for they live under the guidance of emotion, and pursue\nabove all what is pleasant to themselves and what is immediately before\nthem; but with increasing age their pleasures become different. This is\nwhy they quickly become friends and quickly cease to be so; their friend-\nship changes with the object that is found pleasant, and such pleasure\nalters quickly. Young people are amorous too; for the greater part of the\nfriendship of love depends on emotion and aims at pleasure; this is why\nthey fall in love and quickly fall out of love, changing often within a\nsingle day. But these people do wish to spend their days and lives to-\ngether; for it is thus that they attain the purpose of their friendship.\nPerfect friendship is the friendship of men who are good, and alike\nin virtue; for these wish well alike to each other qua good, and they are\ngood themselves. Now those who wish well to their friends for their\nsake are most truly friends; for they do this by reason of own nature and\nnot incidentally; therefore their friendship lasts as long as they are good-\nand goodness is an enduring thing. And each is good without qualifica-\ntion and to his friend, for the good are both good without qualification\nand useful to each other. So too they are pleasant; for the good are\npleasant both without qualification and to each other, since to each his\nown activities and others like them are pleasurable, and the actions of\nthe good are the same or like. And such a friendship is as might be\nexpected permanent, since there meet in it all the qualities that friends\nshould have. For all friendship is for the sake of good or of pleasure-\ngood or pleasure either in the abstract or such as will be enjoyed by him\nwho has the friendly feeling-and is based on a certain resemblance; and\nto a friendship of good men all the qualities we have named belong in\nvirtue of the nature of the friends themselves; for in the case of this kind\nof friendship the other qualities also are alike in both friends, and that\nwhich is good without qualification is also without qualification pleas-\nant, and these are the most lovable qualities. Love and friendship there-\nfore are found most and in their best form between such men.\nBut it is natural that such friendships should be infrequent; for such\nmen are rare. Further, such friendship requires time and familiarity; as\nthe proverb says, men cannot know each other till they have ‘eaten salt\ntogether’; nor can they admit each other to friendship or be friends till\neach has been found lovable and been trusted by each. Those who quickly\nshow the marks of friendship to each other wish to be friends, but are\nnot friends unless they both are lovable and know the fact; for a wish for\nfriendship may arise quickly, but friendship does not.",

    "text": "This kind of friendship, then, is perfect both in respect of duration and\nin all other respects, and in it each gets from each in all respects the\nsame as, or something like what, he gives; which is what ought to hap-\npen between friends. Friendship for the sake of pleasure bears a resem-\nblance to this kind; for good people too are pleasant to each other. So\ntoo does friendship for the sake of utility; for the good are also useful to\neach other. Among men of these inferior sorts too, friendships are most\npermanent when the friends get the same thing from each other (e.g.,\npleasure), and not only that but also from the same source, as happens\nbetween readywitted people, not as happens between lover and beloved.\nFor these do not take pleasure in the same things, but the one in seeing\nthe beloved and the other in receiving attentions from his lover; and\nwhen the bloom of youth is passing the friendship sometimes passes too\n(for the one finds no pleasure in the sight of the other, and the other gets\nno attentions from the first); but many lovers on the other hand are\nconstant, if familiarity has led them to love each other’s characters,\nthese being alike. But those who exchange not pleasure but utility in\ntheir amour are both less truly friends and less constant. Those who are\nfriends for the sake of utility part when the advantage is at an end; for\nthey were lovers not of each other but of profit.\nFor the sake of pleasure or utility, then, even bad men may be friends\nof each other, or good men of bad, or one who is neither good nor bad\nmay be a friend to any sort of person, but for their own sake clearly only\ngood men can be friends; for bad men do not delight in each other unless\nsome advantage come of the relation.\nThe friendship of the good too and this alone is proof against slan-\nder; for it is not easy to trust any one talk about a man who has long\nbeen tested by oneself; and it is among good men that trust and the\nfeeling that ‘he would never wrong me’ and all the other things that are\ndemanded in true friendship are found. In the other kinds of friendship,\nhowever, there is nothing to prevent these evils arising. For men apply\nthe name of friends even to those whose motive is utility, in which sense\nstates are said to be friendly (for the alliances of states seem to aim at\nadvantage), and to those who love each other for the sake of pleasure, in\nwhich sense children are called friends. Therefore we too ought perhaps\nto call such people friends, and say that there are several kinds of friend-\nship—firstly and in the proper sense that of good men qua good, and by\nanalogy the other kinds; for it is in virtue of something good and some-\nthing akin to what is found in true friendship that they are friends, since\neven the pleasant is good for the lovers of pleasure. But these two kinds\nof friendship are not often united, nor do the same people become friends\nfor the sake of utility and of pleasure; for things that are only inciden-\ntally connected are not often coupled together.\nFriendship being divided into these kinds, bad men will be friends\nfor the sake of pleasure or of utility, being in this respect like each other,\nbut good men will be friends for their own sake, i.e., in virtue of their\ngoodness. These, then, are friends without qualification; the others are\nfriends incidentally and through a resemblance to these.",

But if the absence is lasting, it seems actually to make men\nforget their friendship; hence the saying ‘out of sight, out of mind’.\nNeither old people nor sour people seem to make friends easily; for\nthere is little that is pleasant in them, and no one can spend his days with\none whose company is painful, or not pleasant, since nature seems above\nall to avoid the painful and to aim at the pleasant. Those, however, who\napprove of each other but do not live together seem to be well-disposed\nrather than actual friends. For there is nothing so characteristic of friends\nas living together (since while it people who are in need that desire ben-\nefits, even those who are supremely happy desire to spend their days\ntogether; for solitude suits such people least of all); but people cannot\nlive together if they are not pleasant and do not enjoy the same things, as\nfriends who are companions seem to do.\nThe truest friendship, then, is that of the good, as we have fre-\nquently said; for that which is without qualification good or pleasant\nseems to be lovable and desirable, and for each person that which is\ngood or pleasant to him; and the good man is lovable and desirable to\nthe good man for both these reasons. Now it looks as if love were a\nfeeling, friendship a state of character; for love may be felt just as much\ntowards lifeless things, but mutual love involves choice and choice springs\nfrom a state of character; and men wish well to those whom they love,\nfor their sake, not as a result of feeling but as a result of a state of\ncharacter. And in loving a friend men love what is good for themselves;\nfor the good man in becoming a friend becomes a good to his friend.\nEach, then, both loves what is good for himself, and makes an equal\nreturn in goodwill and in pleasantness; for friendship is said to be equal-\nity, and both of these are found most in the friendship of the good.",

    "text": "Between sour and elderly people friendship arises less readily, inas-\nmuch as they are less good-tempered and enjoy companionship less; for\nthese are thou to be the greatest marks of friendship productive of it.\nThis is why, while men become friends quickly, old men do not; it is\nbecause men do not become friends with those in whom they do not\ndelight; and similarly sour people do not quickly make friends either.\nBut such men may bear goodwill to each other; for they wish one an-\nother well and aid one another in need; but they are hardly friends be-\ncause they do not spend their days together nor delight in each other,\nand these are thought the greatest marks of friendship.\nOne cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friend-\nship of the perfect type with them, just as one cannot be in love with\nmany people at once (for love is a sort of excess of feeling, and it is the\nnature of such only to be felt towards one person); and it is not easy for\nmany people at the same time to please the same person very greatly, or\nperhaps even to be good in his eyes. One must, too, acquire some expe-\nrience of the other person and become familiar with him, and that is\nvery hard. But with a view to utility or pleasure it is possible that many\npeople should please one; for many people are useful or pleasant, and\nthese services take little time.\nOf these two kinds that which is for the sake of pleasure is the more\nlike friendship, when both parties get the same things from each other\nand delight in each other or in the things, as in the friendships of the\nyoung; for generosity is more found in such friendships. Friendship based\non utility is for the commercially minded. People who are supremely\nhappy, too, have no need of useful friends, but do need pleasant friends;\nfor they wish to live with some one and, though they can endure for a\nshort time what is painful, no one could put up with it continuously, nor\neven with the Good itself if it were painful to him; this is why they look\nout for friends who are pleasant. Perhaps they should look out for friends\nwho, being pleasant, are also good, and good for them too; for so they\nwill have all the characteristics that friends should have.\nPeople in positions of authority seem to have friends who fall into\ndistinct classes; some people are useful to them and others are pleasant,\nbut the same people are rarely both; for they seek neither those whose\npleasantness is accompanied by virtue nor those whose utility is with a\nview to noble objects, but in their desire for pleasure they seek for ready-\nwitted people, and their other friends they choose as being clever at\ndoing what they are told, and these characteristics are rarely combined.\nNow we have said that the good man is at the same time pleasant and\nuseful; but such a man does not become the friend of one who surpasses\nhim in station, unless he is surpassed also in virtue; if this is not so, he\ndoes not establish equality by being proportionally exceeded in both\nrespects. But people who surpass him in both respects are not so easy to\nfind.\nHowever that may be, the aforesaid friendships involve equality;\nfor the friends get the same things from one another and wish the same\nthings for one another, or exchange one thing for another, e.g., pleasure\nfor utility; we have said, however, that they are both less truly friend-\nships and less permanent.\nBut it is from their likeness and their unlikeness to the same thing\nthat they are thought both to be and not to be friendships. It is by their\nlikeness to the friendship of virtue that they seem to be friendships (for\none of them involves pleasure and the other utility, and these character-\nistics belong to the friendship of virtue as well); while it is because the\nfriendship of virtue is proof against slander and permanent, while these\nquickly change (besides differing from the former in many other re-\nspects), that they appear not to be friendships; i.e., it is because of their\nunlikeness to the friendship of virtue.",

    "text": "But there is another kind of friendship, viz., that which involves an\ninequality between the parties, e.g., that of father to son and in general\nof elder to younger, that of man to wife and in general that of ruler to\nsubject. And these friendships differ also from each other; for it is not\nthe same that exists between parents and children and between rulers\nand subjects, nor is even that of father to son the same as that of son to\nfather, nor that of husband to wife the same as that of wife to husband.\nFor the virtue and the function of each of these is different, and so are\nthe reasons for which they love; the love and the friendship are therefore\ndifferent also. Each party, then, neither gets the same from the other, nor\nought to seek it; but when children render to parents what they ought to\nrender to those who brought them into the world, and parents render\nwhat they should to their children, the friendship of such persons will be\nabiding and excellent. In all friendships implying inequality the love\nalso should be proportional, i.e., the better should be more loved than he\nloves, and so should the more useful, and similarly in each of the other\ncases; for when the love is in proportion to the merit of the parties, then\nin a sense arises equality, which is certainly held to be characteristic of\nfriendship.\nBut equality does not seem to take the same form in acts of justice\nand in friendship; for in acts of justice what is equal in the primary\nsense is that which is in proportion to merit, while quantitative equality\nis secondary, but in friendship quantitative equality is primary and pro-\nportion to merit secondary. This becomes clear if there is a great inter-\nval in respect of virtue or vice or wealth or anything else between the\nparties; for then they are no longer friends, and do not even expect to be\nso. And this is most manifest in the case of the gods; for they surpass us\nmost decisively in all good things. But it is clear also in the case of\nkings; for with them, too, men who are much their inferiors do not ex-\npect to be friends; nor do men of no account expect to be friends with\nthe best or wisest men. In such cases it is not possible to define exactly\nup to what point friends can remain friends; for much can be taken\naway and friendship remain, but when one party is removed to a great\ndistance, as God is, the possibility of friendship ceases. This is in fact\nthe origin of the question whether friends really wish for their friends\nthe greatest goods, e.g., that of being gods; since in that case their friends\nwill no longer be friends to them, and therefore will not be good things\nfor them (for friends are good things). The answer is that if we were\nright in saying that friend wishes good to friend for his sake, his friend\nmust remain the sort of being he is, whatever that may be; therefore it is\nfor him oily so long as he remains a man that he will wish the greatest\ngoods. But perhaps not all the greatest goods; for it is for himself most\nof all that each man wishes what is good.",

    "text": "Most people seem, owing to ambition, to wish to be loved rather than to\nlove; which is why most men love flattery; for the flatterer is a friend in\nan inferior position, or pretends to be such and to love more than he is\nloved; and being loved seems to be akin to being honoured, and this is\nwhat most people aim at. But it seems to be not for its own sake that\npeople choose honour, but incidentally. For most people enjoy being\nhonoured by those in positions of authority because of their hopes (for\nthey think that if they want anything they will get it from them; and\ntherefore they delight in honour as a token of favour to come); while\nthose who desire honour from good men, and men who know, are aim-\ning at confirming their own opinion of themselves; they delight in honour,\ntherefore, because they believe in their own goodness on the strength of\nthe judgement of those who speak about them. In being loved, on the\nother hand, people delight for its own sake; whence it would seem to be\nbetter than being honoured, and friendship to be desirable in itself. But\nit seems to lie in loving rather than in being loved, as is indicated by the\ndelight mothers take in loving; for some mothers hand over their chil-\ndren to be brought up, and so long as they know their fate they love\nthem and do not seek to be loved in return (if they cannot have both), but\nseem to be satisfied if they see them prospering; and they themselves\nlove their children even if these owing to their ignorance give them noth-\ning of a mother’s due. Now since friendship depends more on loving,\nand it is those who love their friends that are praised, loving seems to be\nthe characteristic virtue of friends, so that it is only those in whom this\nis found in due measure that are lasting friends, and only their friend-\nship that endures.\nIt is in this way more than any other that even unequals can be\nfriends; they can be equalized. Now equality and likeness are friend-\nship, and especially the likeness of those who are like in virtue; for being\nsteadfast in themselves they hold fast to each other, and neither ask nor\ngive base services, but (one may say) even prevent them; for it is char-\nacteristic of good men neither to go wrong themselves nor to let their\nfriends do so. But wicked men have no steadfastness (for they do not\nremain even like to themselves), but become friends for a short time\nbecause they delight in each other’s wickedness. Friends who are useful\nor pleasant last longer; i.e., as long as they provide each other with\nenjoyments or advantages. Friendship for utility’s sake seems to be that\nwhich most easily exists between contraries, e.g., between poor and\nrich, between ignorant and learned; for what a man actually lacks he\naims at, and one gives something else in return. But under this head, too,\nmight bring lover and beloved, beautiful and ugly. This is why lovers\nsometimes seem ridiculous, when they demand to be loved as they love;\nif they are equally lovable their claim can perhaps be justified, but when\nthey have nothing lovable about them it is ridiculous. Perhaps, however,\ncontrary does not even aim at contrary by its own nature, but only inci-\ndentally, the desire being for what is intermediate; for that is what is\ngood, e.g., it is good for the dry not to become wet but to come to the\nintermediate state, and similarly with the hot and in all other cases.\nThese subjects we may dismiss; for they are indeed somewhat foreign to\nour inquiry.",

    "text": "Friendship and justice seem, as we have said at the outset of our discus-\nsion, to be concerned with the same objects and exhibited between the\nsame persons. For in every community there is thought to be some form\nof justice, and friendship too; at least men address as friends their fel-\nlow-voyagers and fellow-soldiers, and so too those associated with them\nin any other kind of community. And the extent of their association is\nthe extent of their friendship, as it is the extent to which justice exists\nbetween them. And the proverb ‘what friends have is common property’\nexpresses the truth; for friendship depends on community. Now broth-\ners and comrades have all things in common, but the others to whom we\nhave referred have definite things in common—some more things, oth-\ners fewer; for of friendships, too, some are more and others less truly\nfriendships. And the claims of justice differ too; the duties of parents to\nchildren, and those of brothers to each other are not the same, nor those\nof comrades and those of fellow-citizens, and so, too, with the other\nkinds of friendship. There is a difference, therefore, also between the\nacts that are unjust towards each of these classes of associates, and the\ninjustice increases by being exhibited towards those who are friends in a\nfuller sense; e.g., it is a more terrible thing to defraud a comrade than a\nfellow-citizen, more terrible not to help a brother than a stranger, and\nmore terrible to wound a father than any one else. And the demands of\njustice also seem to increase with the intensity of the friendship, which\nimplies that friendship and justice exist between the same persons and\nhave an equal extension.\nNow all forms of community are like parts of the political commu-\nnity; for men journey together with a view to some particular advan-\ntage, and to provide something that they need for the purposes of life;\nand it is for the sake of advantage that the political community too seems\nboth to have come together originally and to endure, for this is what\nlegislators aim at, and they call just that which is to the common advan-\ntage. Now the other communities aim at advantage bit by bit, e.g., sail-\nors at what is advantageous on a voyage with a view to making money\nor something of the kind, fellow-soldiers at what is advantageous in\nwar, whether it is wealth or victory or the taking of a city that they seek,\nand members of tribes and demes act similarly (Some communities seem\nto arise for the sake or pleasure, viz. religious guilds and social clubs;\nfor these exist respectively for the sake of offering sacrifice and of com-\npanionship. But all these seem to fall under the political community; for\nit aims not at present advantage but at what is advantageous for life as\na whole), offering sacrifices and arranging gatherings for the purpose,\nand assigning honours to the gods, and providing pleasant relaxations\nfor themselves. For the ancient sacrifices and gatherings seem to take\nplace after the harvest as a sort of firstfruits, because it was at these\nseasons that people had most leisure. All the communities, then, seem to\nbe parts of the political community; and the particular kinds friendship\nwill correspond to the particular kinds of community.",

    "text": "There are three kinds of constitution, and an equal number of deviation-\nforms—perversions, as it were, of them. The constitutions are monar-\nchy, aristocracy, and thirdly that which is based on a property qualifica-\ntion, which it seems appropriate to call timocratic, though most people\nare wont to call it polity. The best of these is monarchy, the worst\ntimocracy. The deviation from monarchy is tyrany; for both are forms\nof one-man rule, but there is the greatest difference between them; the\ntyrant looks to his own advantage, the king to that of his subjects. For a\nman is not a king unless he is sufficient to himself and excels his sub-\njects in all good things; and such a man needs nothing further; therefore\nhe will not look to his own interests but to those of his subjects; for a\nking who is not like that would be a mere titular king. Now tyranny is\nthe very contrary of this; the tyrant pursues his own good. And it is\nclearer in the case of tyranny that it is the worst deviation-form; but it is\nthe contrary of the best that is worst. Monarchy passes over into tyr-\nanny; for tyranny is the evil form of one-man rule and the bad king\nbecomes a tyrant. Aristocracy passes over into oligarchy by the badness\nof the rulers, who distribute contrary to equity what belongs to the city—\nall or most of the good things to themselves, and office always to the\nsame people, paying most regard to wealth; thus the rulers are few and\nare bad men instead of the most worthy. Timocracy passes over into\ndemocracy; for these are coterminous, since it is the ideal even of\ntimocracy to be the rule of the majority, and all who have the property\nqualification count as equal. Democracy is the least bad of the devia-\ntions; for in its case the form of constitution is but a slight deviation.\nThese then are the changes to which constitutions are most subject; for\nthese are the smallest and easiest transitions.\nOne may find resemblances to the constitutions and, as it were,\npatterns of them even in households. For the association of a father with\nhis sons bears the form of monarchy, since the father cares for his chil-\ndren; and this is why Homer calls Zeus ‘father’; it is the ideal of monar-\nchy to be paternal rule. But among the Persians the rule of the father is\ntyrannical; they use their sons as slaves. Tyrannical too is the rule of a\nmaster over slaves; for it is the advantage of the master that is brought\nabout in it. Now this seems to be a correct form of government, but the\nPersian type is perverted; for the modes of rule appropriate to different\nrelations are diverse. The association of man and wife seems to be aris-\ntocratic; for the man rules in accordance with his worth, and in those\nmatters in which a man should rule, but the matters that befit a woman\nhe hands over to her. If the man rules in everything the relation passes\nover into oligarchy; for in doing so he is not acting in accordance with\ntheir respective worth, and not ruling in virtue of his superiority. Some-\ntimes, however, women rule, because they are heiresses; so their rule is\nnot in virtue of excellence but due to wealth and power, as in oligar-\nchies. The association of brothers is like timocracy; for they are equal,\nexcept in so far as they differ in age; hence if they differ much in age, the\nfriendship is no longer of the fraternal type. Democracy is found chiefly\nin masterless dwellings (for here every one is on an equality), and in\nthose in which the ruler is weak and every one has licence to do as he\npleases.",

    "text": "Each of the constitutions may be seen to involve friendship just in so far\nas it involves justice. The friendship between a king and his subjects\ndepends on an excess of benefits conferred; for he confers benefits on\nhis subjects if being a good man he cares for them with a view to their\nwell-being, as a shepherd does for his sheep (whence Homer called\nAgamemnon ‘shepherd of the peoples’). Such too is the friendship of a\nfather, though this exceeds the other in the greatness of the benefits\nconferred; for he is responsible for the existence of his children, which\nis thought the greatest good, and for their nurture and upbringing.\nThese things are ascribed to ancestors as well. Further, by nature a\nfather tends to rule over his sons, ancestors over descendants, a king\nover his subjects. These friendships imply superiority of one party over\nthe other, which is why ancestors are honoured. The justice therefore\nthat exists between persons so related is not the same on both sides but\nis in every case proportioned to merit; for that is true of the friendship as\nwell. The friendship of man and wife, again, is the same that is found in\nan aristocracy; for it is in accordance with virtue the better gets more of\nwhat is good, and each gets what befits him; and so, too, with the justice\nin these relations. The friendship of brothers is like that of comrades;\nfor they are equal and of like age, and such persons are for the most part\nlike in their feelings and their character. Like this, too, is the friendship\nappropriate to timocratic government; for in such a constitution the ideal\nis for the citizens to be equal and fair; therefore rule is taken in turn, and\non equal terms; and the friendship appropriate here will correspond.\nBut in the deviation-forms, as justice hardly exists, so too does friend-\nship. It exists least in the worst form; in tyranny there is little or no\nfriendship. For where there is nothing common to ruler and ruled, there\nis not friendship either, since there is not justice; e.g., between crafts-\nman and tool, soul and body, master and slave; the latter in each case is\nbenefited by that which uses it, but there is no friendship nor justice\ntowards lifeless things. But neither is there friendship towards a horse\nor an ox, nor to a slave qua slave. For there is nothing common to the\ntwo parties; the slave is a living tool and the tool a lifeless slave. Qua\nslave then, one cannot be friends with him. But qua man one can; for\nthere seems to be some justice between any man and any other who can\nshare in a system of law or be a party to an agreement; therefore there\ncan also be friendship with him in so far as he is a man. Therefore while\nin tyrannies friendship and justice hardly exist, in democracies they ex-\nist more fully; for where the citizens are equal they have much in com-\nmon.",

    "text": "Every form of friendship, then, involves association, as has been said.\nOne might, however, mark off from the rest both the friendship of kin-\ndred and that of comrades. Those of fellow-citizens, fellow-tribesmen,\nfellow-voyagers, and the like are more like mere friendships of associa-\ntion; for they seem to rest on a sort of compact. With them we might\nclass the friendship of host and guest. The friendship of kinsmen itself,\nwhile it seems to be of many kinds, appears to depend in every case on\nparental friendship; for parents love their children as being a part of\nthemselves, and children their parents as being something originating\nfrom them. Now (1) parents know their offspring better than there chil-\ndren know that they are their children, and (2) the originator feels his\noffspring to be his own more than the offspring do their begetter; for the\nproduct belongs to the producer (e.g., a tooth or hair or anything else to\nhim whose it is), but the producer does not belong to the product, or\nbelongs in a less degree. And (3) the length of time produces the same\nresult; parents love their children as soon as these are born, but children\nlove their parents only after time has elapsed and they have acquired\nunderstanding or the power of discrimination by the senses. From these\nconsiderations it is also plain why mothers love more than fathers do.\nParents, then, love their children as themselves (for their issue are by\nvirtue of their separate existence a sort of other selves), while children\nlove their parents as being born of them, and brothers love each other as\nbeing born of the same parents; for their identity with them makes them\nidentical with each other (which is the reason why people talk of ‘the\nsame blood,’ ‘the same stock,’ and so on). They are, therefore, in a\nsense the same thing, though in separate individuals. Two things that\ncontribute greatly to friendship are a common upbringing and similarity\nof age; for ‘two of an age take to each other,’ and people brought up\ntogether tend to be comrades; whence the friendship of brothers is akin\nto that of comrades. And cousins and other kinsmen are bound up to-\ngether by derivation from brothers, viz. by being derived from the same\nparents. They come to be closer together or farther apart by virtue of the\nnearness or distance of the original ancestor.\nThe friendship of children to parents, and of men to gods, is a rela-\ntion to them as to something good and superior; for they have conferred\nthe greatest benefits, since they are the causes of their being and of their\nnourishment, and of their education from their birth; and this kind of\nfriendship possesses pleasantness and utility also, more than that of\nstrangers, inasmuch as their life is lived more in common. The friend-\nship of brothers has the characteristics found in that of comrades (and\nespecially when these are good), and in general between people who are\nlike each other, inasmuch as they belong more to each other and start\nwith a love for each other from their very birth, and inasmuch as those\nborn of the same parents and brought up together and similarly edu-\ncated are more akin in character; and the test of time has been applied\nmost fully and convincingly in their case.\nBetween other kinsmen friendly relations are found in due propor-\ntion. Between man and wife friendship seems to exist by nature; for man\nis naturally inclined to form couples—even more than to form cities,\ninasmuch as the household is earlier and more necessary than the city,\nand reproduction is more common to man with the animals. With the\nother animals the union extends only to this point, but human beings\nlive together not only for the sake of reproduction but also for the vari-\nous purposes of life; for from the start the functions are divided, and\nthose of man and woman are different; so they help each other by throw-\ning their peculiar gifts into the common stock. It is for these reasons that\nboth utility and pleasure seem to be found in this kind of friendship. But\nthis friendship may be based also on virtue, if the parties are good; for\neach has its own virtue and they will delight in the fact. And children\nseem to be a bond of union (which is the reason why childless people\npart more easily); for children are a good common to both and what is\ncommon holds them together.\nHow man and wife and in general friend and friend ought mutually\nto behave seems to be the same question as how it is just for them to\nbehave; for a man does not seem to have the same duties to a friend, a\nstranger, a comrade, and a schoolfellow.",

    "text": "There are three kinds of friendship, as we said at the outset of our in-\nquiry, and in respect of each some are friends on an equality and others\nby virtue of a superiority (for not only can equally good men become\nfriends but a better man can make friends with a worse, and similarly in\nfriendships of pleasure or utility the friends may be equal or unequal in\nthe benefits they confer). This being so, equals must effect the required\nequalization on a basis of equality in love and in all other respects,\nwhile unequals must render what is in proportion to their superiority or\ninferiority. Complaints and reproaches arise either only or chiefly in the\nfriendship of utility, and this is only to be expected. For those who are\nfriends on the ground of virtue are anxious to do well by each other\n(since that is a mark of virtue and of friendship), and between men who\nare emulating each other in this there cannot be complaints or quarrels;\nno one is offended by a man who loves him and does well by him—if he\nis a person of nice feeling he takes his revenge by doing well by the\nother. And the man who excels the other in the services he renders will\nnot complain of his friend, since he gets what he aims at; for each man\ndesires what is good. Nor do complaints arise much even in friendships\nof pleasure; for both get at the same time what they desire, if they enjoy\nspending their time together; and even a man who complained of an-\nother for not affording him pleasure would seem ridiculous, since it is in\nhis power not to spend his days with him.\nBut the friendship of utility is full of complaints; for as they use\neach other for their own interests they always want to get the better of\nthe bargain, and think they have got less than they should, and blame\ntheir partners because they do not get all they ‘want and deserve’; and\nthose who do well by others cannot help them as much as those whom\nthey benefit want.\nNow it seems that, as justice is of two kinds, one unwritten and the\nother legal, one kind of friendship of utility is moral and the other legal.\nAnd so complaints arise most of all when men do not dissolve the rela-\ntion in the spirit of the same type of friendship in which they contracted\nit. The legal type is that which is on fixed terms; its purely commercial\nvariety is on the basis of immediate payment, while the more liberal\nvariety allows time but stipulates for a definite quid pro quo. In this\nvariety the debt is clear and not ambiguous, but in the postponement it\ncontains an element of friendliness; and so some states do not allow\nsuits arising out of such agreements, but think men who have bargained\non a basis of credit ought to accept the consequences. The moral type is\nnot on fixed terms; it makes a gift, or does whatever it does, as to a\nfriend; but one expects to receive as much or more, as having not given\nbut lent; and if a man is worse off when the relation is dissolved than he\nwas when it was contracted he will complain. This happens because all\nor most men, while they wish for what is noble, choose what is advanta-\ngeous; now it is noble to do well by another without a view to repay-\nment, but it is the receiving of benefits that is advantageous. Therefore\nif we can we should return the equivalent of what we have received (for\nwe must not make a man our friend against his will; we must recognize\nthat we were mistaken at the first and took a benefit from a person we\nshould not have taken it from—since it was not from a friend, nor from\none who did it just for the sake of acting so—and we must settle up just\nas if we had been benefited on fixed terms). Indeed, one would agree to\nrepay if one could (if one could not, even the giver would not have\nexpected one to do so); therefore if it is possible we must repay. But at\nthe outset we must consider the man by whom we are being benefited\nand on what terms he is acting, in order that we may accept the benefit\non these terms, or else decline it.\nIt is disputable whether we ought to measure a service by its utility\nto the receiver and make the return with a view to that, or by the benevo-\nlence of the giver. For those who have received say they have received\nfrom their benefactors what meant little to the latter and what they might\nhave got from others—minimizing the service; while the givers, on the\ncontrary, say it was the biggest thing they had, and what could not have\nbeen got from others, and that it was given in times of danger or similar\nneed. Now if the friendship is one that aims at utility, surely the advan-\ntage to the receiver is the measure. For it is he that asks for the service,\nand the other man helps him on the assumption that he will receive the\nequivalent; so the assistance has been precisely as great as the advan-\ntage to the receiver, and therefore he must return as much as he has\nreceived, or even more (for that would be nobler). In friendships based\non virtue on the other hand, complaints do not arise, but the purpose of\nthe doer is a sort of measure; for in purpose lies the essential element of\nvirtue and character.",

    "text": "Differences arise also in friendships based on superiority; for each ex-\npects to get more out of them, but when this happens the friendship is\ndissolved. Not only does the better man think he ought to get more, since\nmore should be assigned to a good man, but the more useful similarly\nexpects this; they say a useless man should not get as much as they\nshould, since it becomes an act of public service and not a friendship if\nthe proceeds of the friendship do not answer to the worth of the benefits\nconferred. For they think that, as in a commercial partnership those who\nput more in get more out, so it should be in friendship. But the man who\nis in a state of need and inferiority makes the opposite claim; they think\nit is the part of a good friend to help those who are in need; what, they\nsay, is the use of being the friend of a good man or a powerful man, if\none is to get nothing out of it?\nAt all events it seems that each party is justified in his claim, and\nthat each should get more out of the friendship than the other—not more\nof the same thing, however, but the superior more honour and the infe-\nrior more gain; for honour is the prize of virtue and of beneficence,\nwhile gain is the assistance required by inferiority.\nIt seems to be so in constitutional arrangements also; the man who\ncontributes nothing good to the common stock is not honoured; for what\nbelongs to the public is given to the man who benefits the public, and\nhonour does belong to the public. It is not possible to get wealth from\nthe common stock and at the same time honour. For no one puts up with\nthe smaller share in all things; therefore to the man who loses in wealth\nthey assign honour and to the man who is willing to be paid, wealth,\nsince the proportion to merit equalizes the parties and preserves the\nfriendship, as we have said. This then is also the way in which we should\nassociate with unequals; the man who is benefited in respect of wealth\nor virtue must give honour in return, repaying what he can. For friend-\nship asks a man to do what he can, not what is proportional to the merits\nof the case; since that cannot always be done, e.g., in honours paid to\nthe gods or to parents; for no one could ever return to them the equiva-\nlent of what he gets, but the man who serves them to the utmost of his\npower is thought to be a good man. This is why it would not seem open\nto a man to disown his father (though a father may disown his son);\nbeing in debt, he should repay, but there is nothing by doing which a son\nwill have done the equivalent of what he has received, so that he is\nalways in debt. But creditors can remit a debt; and a father can therefore\ndo so too. At the same time it is thought that presumably no one would\nrepudiate a son who was not far gone in wickedness; for apart from the\nnatural friendship of father and son it is human nature not to reject a\nson’s assistance. But the son, if he is wicked, will naturally avoid aiding\nhis father, or not be zealous about it; for most people wish to get ben-\nefits, but avoid doing them, as a thing unprofitable.—So much for these\nquestions.",

    "text": "In all friendships between dissimilars it is, as we have said, proportion\nthat equalizes the parties and preserves the friendship; e.g., in the politi-\ncal form of friendship the shoemaker gets a return for his shoes in pro-\nportion to his worth, and the weaver and all other craftsmen do the\nsame. Now here a common measure has been provided in the form of\nmoney, and therefore everything is referred to this and measured by this;\nbut in the friendship of lovers sometimes the lover complains that his\nexcess of love is not met by love in return though perhaps there is noth-\ning lovable about him), while often the beloved complains that the lover\nwho formerly promised everything now performs nothing. Such inci-\ndents happen when the lover loves the beloved for the sake of pleasure\nwhile the beloved loves the lover for the sake of utility, and they do not\nboth possess the qualities expected of them. If these be the objects of the\nfriendship it is dissolved when they do not get the things that formed the\nmotives of their love; for each did not love the other person himself but\nthe qualities he had, and these were not enduring; that is why the friend-\nships also are transient. But the love of characters, as has been said,\nendures because it is self-dependent. Differences arise when what they\nget is something different and not what they desire; for it is like getting\nnothing at all when we do not get what we aim at; compare the story of\nthe person who made promises to a lyre-player, promising him the more,\nthe better he sang, but in the morning, when the other demanded the\nfulfilment of his promises, said that he had given pleasure for pleasure.\nNow if this had been what each wanted, all would have been well; but if\nthe one wanted enjoyment but the other gain, and the one has what he\nwants while the other has not, the terms of the association will not have\nbeen properly fulfilled; for what each in fact wants is what he attends to,\nand it is for the sake of that that that he will give what he has.\nBut who is to fix the worth of the service; he who makes the sacri-\nfice or he who has got the advantage? At any rate the other seems to\nleave it to him. This is what they say Protagoras used to do; whenever\nhe taught anything whatsoever, he bade the learner assess the value of\nthe knowledge, and accepted the amount so fixed. But in such matters\nsome men approve of the saying ‘let a man have his fixed reward’.\nThose who get the money first and then do none of the things they said\nthey would, owing to the extravagance of their promises, naturally find\nthemselves the objects of complaint; for they do not fulfil what they\nagreed to. The sophists are perhaps compelled to do this because no one\nwould give money for the things they do know. These people then, if\nthey do not do what they have been paid for, are naturally made the\nobjects of complaint.\nBut where there is no contract of service, those who give up some-\nthing for the sake of the other party cannot (as we have said) be com-\nplained of (for that is the nature of the friendship of virtue), and the\nreturn to them must be made on the basis of their purpose (for it is\npurpose that is the characteristic thing in a friend and in virtue). And so\ntoo, it seems, should one make a return to those with whom one has\nstudied philosophy; for their worth cannot be measured against money,\nand they can get no honour which will balance their services, but still it\nis perhaps enough, as it is with the gods and with one’s parents, to give\nthem what one can.\nIf the gift was not of this sort, but was made with a view to a return,\nit is no doubt preferable that the return made should be one that seems\nfair to both parties, but if this cannot be achieved, it would seem not\nonly necessary that the person who gets the first service should fix the\nreward, but also just; for if the other gets in return the equivalent of the\nadvantage the beneficiary has received, or the price lie would have paid\nfor the pleasure, he will have got what is fair as from the other.\nWe see this happening too with things put up for sale, and in some\nplaces there are laws providing that no actions shall arise out of volun-\ntary contracts, on the assumption that one should settle with a person to\nwhom one has given credit, in the spirit in which one bargained with\nhim. The law holds that it is more just that the person to whom credit\nwas given should fix the terms than that the person who gave credit\nshould do so. For most things are not assessed at the same value by\nthose who have them and those who want them; each class values highly\nwhat is its own and what it is offering; yet the return is made on the\nterms fixed by the receiver. But no doubt the receiver should assess a\nthing not at what it seems worth when he has it, but at what he assessed\nit at before he had it.",

    "text": "A further problem is set by such questions as, whether one should in all\nthings give the preference to one’s father and obey him, or whether when\none is ill one should trust a doctor, and when one has to elect a general\nshould elect a man of military skill; and similarly whether one should\nrender a service by preference to a friend or to a good man, and should\nshow gratitude to a benefactor or oblige a friend, if one cannot do both.\nAll such questions are hard, are they not, to decide with precision?\nFor they admit of many variations of all sorts in respect both of the\nmagnitude of the service and of its nobility necessity. But that we should\nnot give the preference in all things to the same person is plain enough;\nand we must for the most part return benefits rather than oblige friends,\nas we must pay back a loan to a creditor rather than make one to a\nfriend. But perhaps even this is not always true; e.g., should a man who\nhas been ransomed out of the hands of brigands ransom his ransomer in\nreturn, whoever he may be (or pay him if he has not been captured but\ndemands payment) or should he ransom his father? It would seem that\nhe should ransom his father in preference even to himself. As we have\nsaid, then, generally the debt should be paid, but if the gift is exceed-\ningly noble or exceedingly necessary, one should defer to these consid-\nerations. For sometimes it is not even fair to return the equivalent of\nwhat one has received, when the one man has done a service to one\nwhom he knows to be good, while the other makes a return to one whom\nhe believes to be bad. For that matter, one should sometimes not lend in\nreturn to one who has lent to oneself; for the one person lent to a good\nman, expecting to recover his loan, while the other has no hope of recov-\nering from one who is believed to be bad. Therefore if the facts really\nare so, the demand is not fair; and if they are not, but people think they\nare, they would be held to be doing nothing strange in refusing. As we\nhave often pointed out, then, discussions about feelings and actions have\njust as much definiteness as their subject-matter.\nThat we should not make the same return to every one, nor give a\nfather the preference in everything, as one does not sacrifice everything\nto Zeus, is plain enough; but since we ought to render different things to\nparents, brothers, comrades, and benefactors, we ought to render to each\nclass what is appropriate and becoming. And this is what people seem\nin fact to do; to marriages they invite their kinsfolk; for these have a part\nin the family and therefore in the doings that affect the family; and at\nfunerals also they think that kinsfolk, before all others, should meet, for\nthe same reason. And it would be thought that in the matter of food we\nshould help our parents before all others, since we owe our own nour-\nishment to them, and it is more honourable to help in this respect the\nauthors of our being even before ourselves; and honour too one should\ngive to one’s parents as one does to the gods, but not any and every\nhonour; for that matter one should not give the same honour to one’s\nfather and one’s mother, nor again should one give them the honour due\nto a philosopher or to a general, but the honour due to a father, or again\nto a mother. To all older persons, too, one should give honour appropri-\nate to their age, by rising to receive them and finding seats for them and\nso on; while to comrades and brothers one should allow freedom of\nspeech and common use of all things. To kinsmen, too, and fellow-tribes-\nmen and fellow-citizens and to every other class one should always try\nto assign what is appropriate, and to compare the claims of each class\nwith respect to nearness of relation and to virtue or usefulness. The\ncomparison is easier when the persons belong to the same class, and\nmore laborious when they are different. Yet we must not on that account\nshrink from the task, but decide the question as best we can.",

    "text": "Another question that arises is whether friendships should or should not\nbe broken off when the other party does not remain the same. Perhaps\nwe may say that there is nothing strange in breaking off a friendship\nbased on utility or pleasure, when our friends no longer have these at-\ntributes. For it was of these attributes that we were the friends; and\nwhen these have failed it is reasonable to love no longer. But one might\ncomplain of another if, when he loved us for our usefulness or pleasant-\nness, he pretended to love us for our character. For, as we said at the\noutset, most differences arise between friends when they are not friends\nin the spirit in which they think they are. So when a man has deceived\nhimself and has thought he was being loved for his character, when the\nother person was doing nothing of the kind, he must blame himself;\nwhen he has been deceived by the pretences of the other person, it is just\nthat he should complain against his deceiver; he will complain with more\njustice than one does against people who counterfeit the currency, inas-\nmuch as the wrongdoing is concerned with something more valuable.\nBut if one accepts another man as good, and he turns out badly and\nis seen to do so, must one still love him? Surely it is impossible, since\nnot everything can be loved, but only what is good. What is evil neither\ncan nor should be loved; for it is not one’s duty to be a lover of evil, nor\nto become like what is bad; and we have said that like is dear like. Must\nthe friendship, then, be forthwith broken off? Or is this not so in all\ncases, but only when one’s friends are incurable in their wickedness? If\nthey are capable of being reformed one should rather come to the assis-\ntance of their character or their property, inasmuch as this is better and\nmore characteristic of friendship. But a man who breaks off such a\nfriendship would seem to be doing nothing strange; for it was not to a\nman of this sort that he was a friend; when his friend has changed,\ntherefore, and he is unable to save him, he gives him up.\nBut if one friend remained the same while the other became better\nand far outstripped him in virtue, should the latter treat the former as a\nfriend? Surely he cannot. When the interval is great this becomes most\nplain, e.g., in the case of childish friendships; if one friend remained a\nchild in intellect while the other became a fully developed man, how\ncould they be friends when they neither approved of the same things nor\ndelighted in and were pained by the same things? For not even with\nregard to each other will their tastes agree, and without this (as we saw)\nthey cannot be friends; for they cannot live together. But we have dis-\ncussed these matters.\nShould he, then, behave no otherwise towards him than he would if\nhe had never been his friend? Surely he should keep a remembrance of\ntheir former intimacy, and as we think we ought to oblige friends rather\nthan strangers, so to those who have been our friends we ought to make\nsome allowance for our former friendship, when the breach has not been\ndue to excess of wickedness.",

    "text": "Friendly relations with one’s neighbours, and the marks by which friend-\nships are defined, seem to have proceeded from a man’s relations to\nhimself. For (1) we define a friend as one who wishes and does what is\ngood, or seems so, for the sake of his friend, or (2) as one who wishes\nhis friend to exist and live, for his sake; which mothers do to their chil-\ndren, and friends do who have come into conflict. And (3) others define\nhim as one who lives with and (4) has the same tastes as another, or (5)\none who grieves and rejoices with his friend; and this too is found in\nmothers most of all. It is by some one of these characterstics that friend-\nship too is defined.\nNow each of these is true of the good man’s relation to himself (and\nof all other men in so far as they think themselves good; virtue and the\ngood man seem, as has been said, to be the measure of every class of\nthings). For his opinions are harmonious, and he desires the same things\nwith all his soul; and therefore he wishes for himself what is good and\nwhat seems so, and does it (for it is characteristic of the good man to\nwork out the good), and does so for his own sake (for he does it for the\nsake of the intellectual element in him, which is thought to be the man\nhimself); and he wishes himself to live and be preserved, and especially\nthe element by virtue of which he thinks. For existence is good to the\nvirtuous man, and each man wishes himself what is good, while no one\nchooses to possess the whole world if he has first to become some one\nelse (for that matter, even now God possesses the good); he wishes for\nthis only on condition of being whatever he is; and the element that\nthinks would seem to be the individual man, or to be so more than any\nother element in him. And such a man wishes to live with himself; for he\ndoes so with pleasure, since the memories of his past acts are delightful\nand his hopes for the future are good, and therefore pleasant. His mind\nis well stored too with subjects of contemplation. And he grieves and\nrejoices, more than any other, with himself; for the same thing is always\npainful, and the same thing always pleasant, and not one thing at one\ntime and another at another; he has, so to speak, nothing to repent of.\nTherefore, since each of these characteristics belongs to the good\nman in relation to himself, and he is related to his friend as to himself\n(for his friend is another self), friendship too is thought to be one of\nthese attributes, and those who have these attributes to be friends. Whether\nthere is or is not friendship between a man and himself is a question we\nmay dismiss for the present; there would seem to be friendship in so far\nas he is two or more, to judge from the afore-mentioned attributes of\nfriendship, and from the fact that the extreme of friendship is likened to\none’s love for oneself.\nBut the attributes named seem to belong even to the majority of\nmen, poor creatures though they may be. Are we to say then that in so\nfar as they are satisfied with themselves and think they are good, they\nshare in these attributes? Certainly no one who is thoroughly bad and\nimpious has these attributes, or even seems to do so. They hardly belong\neven to inferior people; for they are at variance with themselves, and\nhave appetites for some things and rational desires for others. This is\ntrue, for instance, of incontinent people; for they choose, instead of the\nthings they themselves think good, things that are pleasant but hurtful;\nwhile others again, through cowardice and laziness, shrink from doing\nwhat they think best for themselves. And those who have done many\nterrible deeds and are hated for their wickedness even shrink from life\nand destroy themselves. And wicked men seek for people with whom to\nspend their days, and shun themselves; for they remember many a\ngrevious deed, and anticipate others like them, when they are by them-\nselves, but when they are with others they forget. And having nothing\nlovable in them they have no feeling of love to themselves. Therefore\nalso such men do not rejoice or grieve with themselves; for their soul is\nrent by faction, and one element in it by reason of its wickedness grieves\nwhen it abstains from certain acts, while the other part is pleased, and\none draws them this way and the other that, as if they were pulling them\nin pieces. If a man cannot at the same time be pained and pleased, at all\nevents after a short time he is pained because he was pleased, and he\ncould have wished that these things had not been pleasant to him; for\nbad men are laden with repentance.\nTherefore the bad man does not seem to be amicably disposed even\nto himself, because there is nothing in him to love; so that if to be thus is\nthe height of wretchedness, we should strain every nerve to avoid wick-\nedness and should endeavour to be good; for so and only so can one be\neither friendly to oneself or a friend to another.",

    "text": "Goodwill is a friendly sort of relation, but is not identical with friend-\nship; for one may have goodwill both towards people whom one does\nnot know, and without their knowing it, but not friendship. This has\nindeed been said already.’ But goodwill is not even friendly feeling. For\nit does not involve intensity or desire, whereas these accompany friendly\nfeeling; and friendly feeling implies intimacy while goodwill may arise\nof a sudden, as it does towards competitors in a contest; we come to feel\ngoodwill for them and to share in their wishes, but we would not do\nanything with them; for, as we said, we feel goodwill suddenly and love\nthem only superficially.\nGoodwill seems, then, to be a beginning of friendship, as the plea-\nsure of the eye is the beginning of love. For no one loves if he has not\nfirst been delighted by the form of the beloved, but he who delights in\nthe form of another does not, for all that, love him, but only does so\nwhen he also longs for him when absent and craves for his presence; so\ntoo it is not possible for people to be friends if they have not come to feel\ngoodwill for each other, but those who feel goodwill are not for all that\nfriends; for they only wish well to those for whom they feel goodwill,\nand would not do anything with them nor take trouble for them. And so\none might by an extension of the term friendship say that goodwill is\ninactive friendship, though when it is prolonged and reaches the point of\nintimacy it becomes friendship—not the friendship based on utility nor\nthat based on pleasure; for goodwill too does not arise on those terms.\nThe man who has received a benefit bestows goodwill in return for what\nhas been done to him, but in doing so is only doing what is just; while he\nwho wishes some one to prosper because he hopes for enrichment through\nhim seems to have goodwill not to him but rather to himself, just as a\nman is not a friend to another if he cherishes him for the sake of some\nuse to be made of him. In general, goodwill arises on account of some\nexcellence and worth, when one man seems to another beautiful or brave\nor something of the sort, as we pointed out in the case of competitors in\na contest.",

    "text": "Unanimity also seems to be a friendly relation. For this reason it is not\nidentity of opinion; for that might occur even with people who do not\nknow each other; nor do we say that people who have the same views on\nany and every subject are unanimous, e.g., those who agree about the\nheavenly bodies (for unanimity about these is not a friendly relation),\nbut we do say that a city is unanimous when men have the same opinion\nabout what is to their interest, and choose the same actions, and do what\nthey have resolved in common. It is about things to be done, therefore,\nthat people are said to be unanimous, and, among these, about matters\nof consequence and in which it is possible for both or all parties to get\nwhat they want; e.g., a city is unanimous when all its citizens think that\nthe offices in it should be elective, or that they should form an alliance\nwith Sparta, or that Pittacus should be their ruler—at a time when he\nhimself was also willing to rule. But when each of two people wishes\nhimself to have the thing in question, like the captains in the Phoenissae,\nthey are in a state of faction; for it is not unanimity when each of two\nparties thinks of the same thing, whatever that may be, but only when\nthey think of the same thing in the same hands, e.g., when both the\ncommon people and those of the better class wish the best men to rule;\nfor thus and thus alone do all get what they aim at. Unanimity seems,\nthen, to be political friendship, as indeed it is commonly said to be; for\nit is concerned with things that are to our interest and have an influence\non our life.\nNow such unanimity is found among good men; for they are unani-\nmous both in themselves and with one another, being, so to say, of one\nmind (for the wishes of such men are constant and not at the mercy of\nopposing currents like a strait of the sea), and they wish for what is just\nand what is advantageous, and these are the objects of their common\nendeavour as well. But bad men cannot be unanimous except to a small\nextent, any more than they can be friends, since they aim at getting more\nthan their share of advantages, while in labour and public service they\nfall short of their share; and each man wishing for advantage to himself\ncriticizes his neighbour and stands in his way; for if people do not watch\nit carefully the common weal is soon destroyed. The result is that they\nare in a state of faction, putting compulsion on each other but unwilling\nthemselves to do what is just.",

    "text": "Benefactors are thought to love those they have benefited, more than\nthose who have been well treated love those that have treated them well,\nand this is discussed as though it were paradoxical. Most people think it\nis because the latter are in the position of debtors and the former of\ncreditors; and therefore as, in the case of loans, debtors wish their credi-\ntors did not exist, while creditors actually take care of the safety of their\ndebtors, so it is thought that benefactors wish the objects of their action\nto exist since they will then get their gratitude, while the beneficiaries\ntake no interest in making this return. Epicharmus would perhaps de-\nclare that they say this because they ‘look at things on their bad side,’\nbut it is quite like human nature; for most people are forgetful, and are\nmore anxious to be well treated than to treat others well. But the cause\nwould seem to be more deeply rooted in the nature of things; the case of\nthose who have lent money is not even analogous. For they have no\nfriendly feeling to their debtors, but only a wish that they may kept safe\nwith a view to what is to be got from them; while those who have done\na service to others feel friendship and love for those they have served\neven if these are not of any use to them and never will be. This is what\nhappens with craftsmen too; every man loves his own handiwork better\nthan he would be loved by it if it came alive; and this happens perhaps\nmost of all with poets; for they have an excessive love for their own\npoems, doting on them as if they were their children. This is what the\nposition of benefactors is like; for that which they have treated well is\ntheir handiwork, and therefore they love this more than the handiwork\ndoes its maker. The cause of this is that existence is to all men a thing to\nbe chosen and loved, and that we exist by virtue of activity (i.e., by\nliving and acting), and that the handiwork is in a sense, the producer in\nactivity; he loves his handiwork, therefore, because he loves existence.\nAnd this is rooted in the nature of things; for what he is in potentiality,\nhis handiwork manifests in activity.\nAt the same time to the benefactor that is noble which depends on\nhis action, so that he delights in the object of his action, whereas to the\npatient there is nothing noble in the agent, but at most something advan-\ntageous, and this is less pleasant and lovable. What is pleasant is the\nactivity of the present, the hope of the future, the memory of the past;\nbut most pleasant is that which depends on activity, and similarly this is\nmost lovable. Now for a man who has made something his work re-\nmains (for the noble is lasting), but for the person acted on the utility\npasses away. And the memory of noble things is pleasant, but that of\nuseful things is not likely to be pleasant, or is less so; though the reverse\nseems true of expectation.\nFurther, love is like activity, being loved like passivity; and loving\nand its concomitants are attributes of those who are the more active.\nAgain, all men love more what they have won by labour; e.g., those\nwho have made their money love it more than those who have inherited\nit; and to be well treated seems to involve no labour, while to treat others\nwell is a laborious task. These are the reasons, too, why mothers are\nfonder of their children than fathers; bringing them into the world costs\nthem more pains, and they know better that the children are their own.\nThis last point, too, would seem to apply to benefactors.",

    "text": "The question is also debated, whether a man should love himself most,\nor some one else. People criticize those who love themselves most, and\ncall them self-lovers, using this as an epithet of disgrace, and a bad man\nseems to do everything for his own sake, and the more so the more\nwicked he is—and so men reproach him, for instance, with doing noth-\ning of his own accord—while the good man acts for honour’s sake, and\nthe more so the better he is, and acts for his friend’s sake, and sacrifices\nhis own interest.\nBut the facts clash with these arguments, and this is not surprising.\nFor men say that one ought to love best one’s best friend, and man’s best\nfriend is one who wishes well to the object of his wish for his sake, even\nif no one is to know of it; and these attributes are found most of all in a\nman’s attitude towards himself, and so are all the other attributes by\nwhich a friend is defined; for, as we have said, it is from this relation\nthat all the characteristics of friendship have extended to our neighbours.\nAll the proverbs, too, agree with this, e.g., ‘a single soul,’ and ‘what\nfriends have is common property,’ and ‘friendship is equality,’ and ‘char-\nity begins at home’; for all these marks will be found most in a man’s\nrelation to himself; he is his own best friend and therefore ought to love\nhimself best. It is therefore a reasonable question, which of the two\nviews we should follow; for both are plausible.\nPerhaps we ought to mark off such arguments from each other and\ndetermine how far and in what respects each view is right. Now if we\ngrasp the sense in which each school uses the phrase ‘lover of self,’ the\ntruth may become evident. Those who use the term as one of reproach\nascribe self-love to people who assign to themselves the greater share of\nwealth, honours, and bodily pleasures; for these are what most people\ndesire, and busy themselves about as though they were the best of all\nthings, which is the reason, too, why they become objects of competi-\ntion. So those who are grasping with regard to these things gratify their\nappetites and in general their feelings and the irrational element of the\nsoul; and most men are of this nature (which is the reason why the\nepithet has come to be used as it is—it takes its meaning from the pre-\nvailing type of self-love, which is a bad one); it is just, therefore, that\nmen who are lovers of self in this way are reproached for being so. That\nit is those who give themselves the preference in regard to objects of this\nsort that most people usually call lovers of self is plain; for if a man\nwere always anxious that he himself, above all things, should act justly,\ntemperately, or in accordance with any other of the virtues, and in gen-\neral were always to try to secure for himself the honourable course, no\none will call such a man a lover of self or blame him.\nBut such a man would seem more than the other a lover of self; at\nall events he assigns to himself the things that are noblest and best, and\ngratifies the most authoritative element in and in all things obeys this;\nand just as a city or any other systematic whole is most properly identi-\nfied with the most authoritative element in it, so is a man; and therefore\nthe man who loves this and gratifies it is most of all a lover of self.\nBesides, a man is said to have or not to have self-control according as\nhis reason has or has not the control, on the assumption that this is the\nman himself; and the things men have done on a rational principle are\nthought most properly their own acts and voluntary acts. That this is the\nman himself, then, or is so more than anything else, is plain, and also\nthat the good man loves most this part of him. Whence it follows that he\nis most truly a lover of self, of another type than that which is a matter\nof reproach, and as different from that as living according to a rational\nprinciple is from living as passion dictates, and desiring what is noble\nfrom desiring what seems advantageous. Those, then, who busy them-\nselves in an exceptional degree with noble actions all men approve and\npraise; and if all were to strive towards what is noble and strain every\nnerve to do the noblest deeds, everything would be as it should be for the\ncommon weal, and every one would secure for himself the goods that\nare greatest, since virtue is the greatest of goods.\nTherefore the good man should be a lover of self (for he will both\nhimself profit by doing noble acts, and will benefit his fellows), but the\nwicked man should not; for he will hurt both himself and his neighbours,\nfollowing as he does evil passions. For the wicked man, what he does\nclashes with what he ought to do, but what the good man ought to do he\ndoes; for reason in each of its possessors chooses what is best for itself,\nand the good man obeys his reason. It is true of the good man too that he\ndoes many acts for the sake of his friends and his country, and if neces-\nsary dies for them; for he will throw away both wealth and honours and\nin general the goods that are objects of competition, gaining for himself\nnobility; since he would prefer a short period of intense pleasure to a\nlong one of mild enjoyment, a twelvemonth of noble life to many years\nof humdrum existence, and one great and noble action to many trivial\nones. Now those who die for others doubtless attain this result; it is\ntherefore a great prize that they choose for themselves. They will throw\naway wealth too on condition that their friends will gain more; for while\na man’s friend gains wealth he himself achieves nobility; he is therefore\nassigning the greater good to himself. The same too is true of honour\nand office; all these things he will sacrifice to his friend; for this is noble\nand laudable for himself. Rightly then is he thought to be good, since he\nchooses nobility before all else. But he may even give up actions to his\nfriend; it may be nobler to become the cause of his friend’s acting than\nto act himself. In all the actions, therefore, that men are praised for, the\ngood man is seen to assign to himself the greater share in what is noble.\nIn this sense, then, as has been said, a man should be a lover of self; but\nin the sense in which most men are so, he ought not.",

    "text": "It is also disputed whether the happy man will need friends or not. It is\nsaid that those who are supremely happy and self-sufficient have no\nneed of friends; for they have the things that are good, and therefore\nbeing self-sufficient they need nothing further, while a friend, being an-\nother self, furnishes what a man cannot provide by his own effort; whence\nthe saying ‘when fortune is kind, what need of friends?’ But it seems\nstrange, when one assigns all good things to the happy man, not to as-\nsign friends, who are thought the greatest of external goods. And if it is\nmore characteristic of a friend to do well by another than to be well done\nby, and to confer benefits is characteristic of the good man and of virtue,\nand it is nobler to do well by friends than by strangers, the good man\nwill need people to do well by. This is why the question is asked whether\nwe need friends more in prosperity or in adversity, on the assumption\nthat not only does a man in adversity need people to confer benefits on\nhim, but also those who are prospering need people to do well by. Surely\nit is strange, too, to make the supremely happy man a solitary; for no\none would choose the whole world on condition of being alone, since\nman is a political creature and one whose nature is to live with others.\nTherefore even the happy man lives with others; for he has the things\nthat are by nature good. And plainly it is better to spend his days with\nfriends and good men than with strangers or any chance persons. There-\nfore the happy man needs friends.\nWhat then is it that the first school means, and in what respect is it\nright? Is it that most identify friends with useful people? Of such friends\nindeed the supremely happy man will have no need, since he already has\nthe things that are good; nor will he need those whom one makes one’s\nfriends because of their pleasantness, or he will need them only to a\nsmall extent (for his life, being pleasant, has no need of adventitious\npleasure); and because he does not need such friends he is thought not to\nneed friends.\nBut that is surely not true. For we have said at the outset that hap-\npiness is an activity; and activity plainly comes into being and is not\npresent at the start like a piece of property. If (1) happiness lies in living\nand being active, and the good man’s activity is virtuous and pleasant in\nitself, as we have said at the outset, and (2) a thing’s being one’s own is\none of the attributes that make it pleasant, and (3) we can contemplate\nour neighbours better than ourselves and their actions better than our\nown, and if the actions of virtuous men who are their friends are pleas-\nant to good men (since these have both the attributes that are naturally\npleasant),—if this be so, the supremely happy man will need friends of\nthis sort, since his purpose is to contemplate worthy actions and actions\nthat are his own, and the actions of a good man who is his friend have\nboth these qualities.\nFurther, men think that the happy man ought to live pleasantly. Now\nif he were a solitary, life would be hard for him; for by oneself it is not\neasy to be continuously active; but with others and towards others it is\neasier. With others therefore his activity will be more continuous, and it\nis in itself pleasant, as it ought to be for the man who is supremely\nhappy; for a good man qua good delights in virtuous actions and is\nvexed at vicious ones, as a musical man enjoys beautiful tunes but is\npained at bad ones. A certain training in virtue arises also from the\ncompany of the good, as Theognis has said before us.\nIf we look deeper into the nature of things, a virtuous friend seems\nto be naturally desirable for a virtuous man. For that which is good by\nnature, we have said, is for the virtuous man good and pleasant in itself.\nNow life is defined in the case of animals by the power of perception in\nthat of man by the power of perception or thought; and a power is de-\nfined by reference to the corresponding activity, which is the essential\nthing; therefore life seems to be essentially the act of perceiving or think-\ning. And life is among the things that are good and pleasant in them-\nselves, since it is determinate and the determinate is of the nature of the\ngood; and that which is good by nature is also good for the virtuous man\n(which is the reason why life seems pleasant to all men); but we must\nnot apply this to a wicked and corrupt life nor to a life spent in pain; for\nsuch a life is indeterminate, as are its attributes. The nature of pain will\nbecome plainer in what follows. But if life itself is good and pleasant\n(which it seems to be, from the very fact that all men desire it, and\nparticularly those who are good and supremely happy; for to such men\nlife is most desirable, and their existence is the most supremely happy)\nand if he who sees perceives that he sees, and he who hears, that he\nhears, and he who walks, that he walks, and in the case of all other\nactivities similarly there is something which perceives that we are ac-\ntive, so that if we perceive, we perceive that we perceive, and if we\nthink, that we think; and if to perceive that we perceive or think is to\nperceive that we exist (for existence was defined as perceiving or think-\ning); and if perceiving that one lives is in itself one of the things that are\npleasant (for life is by nature good, and to perceive what is good present\nin oneself is pleasant); and if life is desirable, and particularly so for\ngood men, because to them existence is good and pleasant for they are\npleased at the consciousness of the presence in them of what is in itself\ngood); and if as the virtuous man is to himself, he is to his friend also\n(for his friend is another self):—if all this be true, as his own being is\ndesirable for each man, so, or almost so, is that of his friend. Now his\nbeing was seen to be desirable because he perceived his own goodness,\nand such perception is pleasant in itself. He needs, therefore, to be con-\nscious of the existence of his friend as well, and this will be realized in\ntheir living together and sharing in discussion and thought; for this is\nwhat living together would seem to mean in the case of man, and not, as\nin the case of cattle, feeding in the same place.\nIf, then, being is in itself desirable for the supremely happy man\n(since it is by its nature good and pleasant), and that of his friend is very\nmuch the same, a friend will be one of the things that are desirable. Now\nthat which is desirable for him he must have, or he will be deficient in\nthis respect. The man who is to be happy will therefore need virtuous\nfriends.",

    "text": "Should we, then, make as many friends as possible, or—as in the case\nof hospitality it is thought to be suitable advice, that one should be\n‘neither a man of many guests nor a man with none’—will that apply to\nfriendship as well; should a man neither be friendless nor have an exces-\nsive number of friends?\nTo friends made with a view to utility this saying would seem thor-\noughly applicable; for to do services to many people in return is a labo-\nrious task and life is not long enough for its performance. Therefore\nfriends in excess of those who are sufficient for our own life are super-\nfluous, and hindrances to the noble life; so that we have no need of\nthem. Of friends made with a view to pleasure, also, few are enough, as\na little seasoning in food is enough.\nBut as regards good friends, should we have as many as possible, or\nis there a limit to the number of one’s friends, as there is to the size of a\ncity? You cannot make a city of ten men, and if there are a hundred\nthousand it is a city no longer. But the proper number is presumably not\na single number, but anything that falls between certain fixed points. So\nfor friends too there is a fixed number perhaps the largest number with\nwhom one can live together (for that, we found, thought to be very char-\nacteristic of friendship); and that one cannot live with many people and\ndivide oneself up among them is plain. Further, they too must be friends\nof one another, if they are all to spend their days together; and it is a\nhard business for this condition to be fulfilled with a large number. It is\nfound difficult, too, to rejoice and to grieve in an intimate way with\nmany people, for it may likely happen that one has at once to be happy\nwith one friend and to mourn with another. Presumably, then, it is well\nnot to seek to have as many friends as possible, but as many as are\nenough for the purpose of living together; for it would seem actually\nimpossible to be a great friend to many people. This is why one cannot\nlove several people; love is ideally a sort of excess of friendship, and\nthat can only be felt towards one person; therefore great friendship too\ncan only be felt towards a few people. This seems to be confirmed in\npractice; for we do not find many people who are friends in the com-\nradely way of friendship, and the famous friendships of this sort are\nalways between two people. Those who have many friends and mix\nintimately with them all are thought to be no one’s friend, except in the\nway proper to fellow-citizens, and such people are also called obsequi-\nous. In the way proper to fellow-citizens, indeed, it is possible to be the\nfriend of many and yet not be obsequious but a genuinely good man; but\none cannot have with many people the friendship based on virtue and on\nthe character of our friends themselves, and we must be content if we\nfind even a few such.",

    "text": "Do we need friends more in good fortune or in bad? They are sought\nafter in both; for while men in adversity need help, in prosperity they\nneed people to live with and to make the objects of their beneficence; for\nthey wish to do well by others. Friendship, then, is more necessary in\nbad fortune, and so it is useful friends that one wants in this case; but it\nis more noble in good fortune, and so we also seek for good men as our\nfriends, since it is more desirable to confer benefits on these and to live\nwith these. For the very presence of friends is pleasant both in good\nfortune and also in bad, since grief is lightened when friends sorrow\nwith us. Hence one might ask whether they share as it were our burden,\nor—without that happening—their presence by its pleasantness, and\nthe thought of their grieving with us, make our pain less. Whether it is\nfor these reasons or for some other that our grief is lightened, is a ques-\ntion that may be dismissed; at all events what we have described ap-\npears to take place.\nBut their presence seems to contain a mixture of various factors.\nThe very seeing of one’s friends is pleasant, especially if one is in adver-\nsity, and becomes a safeguard against grief (for a friend tends to com-\nfort us both by the sight of him and by his words, if he is tactful, since he\nknows our character and the things that please or pain us); but to see\nhim pained at our misfortunes is painful; for every one shuns being a\ncause of pain to his friends. For this reason people of a manly nature\nguard against making their friends grieve with them, and, unless he be\nexceptionally insensible to pain, such a man cannot stand the pain that\nensues for his friends, and in general does not admit fellow-mourners\nbecause he is not himself given to mourning; but women and womanly\nmen enjoy sympathisers in their grief, and love them as friends and\ncompanions in sorrow. But in all things one obviously ought to imitate\nthe better type of person.\nOn the other hand, the presence of friends in our prosperity implies\nboth a pleasant passing of our time and the pleasant thought of their\npleasure at our own good fortune. For this cause it would seem that we\nought to summon our friends readily to share our good fortunes (for the\nbeneficent character is a noble one), but summon them to our bad for-\ntunes with hesitation; for we ought to give them as little a share as\npossible in our evils whence the saying ‘enough is my misfortune’. We\nshould summon friends to us most of all when they are likely by suffer-\ning a few inconveniences to do us a great service.\nConversely, it is fitting to go unasked and readily to the aid of those\nin adversity (for it is characteristic of a friend to render services, and\nespecially to those who are in need and have not demanded them; such\naction is nobler and pleasanter for both persons); but when our friends\nare prosperous we should join readily in their activities (for they need\nfriends for these too), but be tardy in coming forward to be the objects\nof their kindness; for it is not noble to be keen to receive benefits. Still,\nwe must no doubt avoid getting the reputation of kill-joys by repulsing\nthem; for that sometimes happens.\nThe presence of friends, then, seems desirable in all circumstances.",

For friendship is a partnership,\nand as a man is to himself, so is he to his friend; now in his own case the\nconsciousness of his being is desirable, and so therefore is the conscious-\nness of his friend’s being, and the activity of this consciousness is pro-\nduced when they live together, so that it is natural that they aim at this.\nAnd whatever existence means for each class of men, whatever it is for\nwhose sake they value life, in that they wish to occupy themselves with\ntheir friends; and so some drink together, others dice together, others\njoin in athletic exercises and hunting, or in the study of philosophy, each\nclass spending their days together in whatever they love most in life; for\nsince they wish to live with their friends, they do and share in those\nthings which give them the sense of living together. Thus the friendship\nof bad men turns out an evil thing (for because of their instability they\nunite in bad pursuits, and besides they become evil by becoming like\neach other), while the friendship of good men is good, being augmented\nby their companionship; and they are thought to become better too by\ntheir activities and by improving each other; for from each other they\ntake the mould of the characteristics they approve—whence the saying\n‘noble deeds from noble men’.—So much, then, for friendship; our next\ntask must be to discuss pleasure.",

    "text": "After these matters we ought perhaps next to discuss pleasure. For it is\nthought to be most intimately connected with our human nature, which\nis the reason why in educating the young we steer them by the rudders of\npleasure and pain; it is thought, too, that to enjoy the things we ought\nand to hate the things we ought has the greatest bearing on virtue of\ncharacter. For these things extend right through life, with a weight and\npower of their own in respect both to virtue and to the happy life, since\nmen choose what is pleasant and avoid what is painful; and such things,\nit will be thought, we should least of all omit to discuss, especially since\nthey admit of much dispute. For some say pleasure is the good, while\nothers, on the contrary, say it is thoroughly bad—some no doubt being\npersuaded that the facts are so, and others thinking it has a better effect\non our life to exhibit pleasure as a bad thing even if it is not; for most\npeople (they think) incline towards it and are the slaves of their plea-\nsures, for which reason they ought to lead them in the opposite direc-\ntion, since thus they will reach the middle state. But surely this is not\ncorrect. For arguments about matters concerned with feelings and ac-\ntions are less reliable than facts: and so when they clash with the facts of\nperception they are despised, and discredit the truth as well; if a man\nwho runs down pleasure is once seen to be alming at it, his inclining\ntowards it is thought to imply that it is all worthy of being aimed at; for\nmost people are not good at drawing distinctions. True arguments seem,\nthen, most useful, not only with a view to knowledge, but with a view to\nlife also; for since they harmonize with the facts they are believed, and\nso they stimulate those who understand them to live according to them.—\nEnough of such questions; let us proceed to review the opinions that\nhave been expressed about pleasure.",

    "text": "Eudoxus thought pleasure was the good because he saw all things, both\nrational and irrational, aiming at it, and because in all things that which\nis the object of choice is what is excellent, and that which is most the\nobject of choice the greatest good; thus the fact that all things moved\ntowards the same object indicated that this was for all things the chief\ngood (for each thing, he argued, finds its own good, as it finds its own\nnourishment); and that which is good for all things and at which all aim\nwas the good. His arguments were credited more because of the excel-\nlence of his character than for their own sake; he was thought to be\nremarkably self-controlled, and therefore it was thought that he was not\nsaying what he did say as a friend of pleasure, but that the facts really\nwere so. He believed that the same conclusion followed no less plainly\nfrom a study of the contrary of pleasure; pain was in itself an object of\naversion to all things, and therefore its contrary must be similarly an\nobject of choice. And again that is most an object of choice which we\nchoose not because or for the sake of something else, and pleasure is\nadmittedly of this nature; for no one asks to what end he is pleased, thus\nimplying that pleasure is in itself an object of choice. Further, he argued\nthat pleasure when added to any good, e.g., to just or temperate action,\nmakes it more worthy of choice, and that it is only by itself that the good\ncan be increased.\nThis argument seems to show it to be one of the goods, and no more\na good than any other; for every good is more worthy of choice along\nwith another good than taken alone. And so it is by an argument of this\nkind that Plato proves the good not to be pleasure; he argues that the\npleasant life is more desirable with wisdom than without, and that if the\nmixture is better, pleasure is not the good; for the good cannot become\nmore desirable by the addition of anything to it. Now it is clear that\nnothing else, any more than pleasure, can be the good if it is made more\ndesirable by the addition of any of the things that are good in them-\nselves. What, then, is there that satisfies this criterion, which at the\nsame time we can participate in? It is something of this sort that we are\nlooking for. Those who object that that at which all things aim is not\nnecessarily good are, we may surmise, talking nonsense. For we say\nthat that which every one thinks really is so; and the man who attacks\nthis belief will hardly have anything more credible to maintain instead.\nIf it is senseless creatures that desire the things in question, there might\nbe something in what they say; but if intelligent creatures do so as well,\nwhat sense can there be in this view? But perhaps even in inferior crea-\ntures there is some natural good stronger than themselves which aims at\ntheir proper good.\nNor does the argument about the contrary of pleasure seem to be\ncorrect. They say that if pain is an evil it does not follow that pleasure is\na good; for evil is opposed to evil and at the same time both are opposed\nto the neutral state—which is correct enough but does not apply to the\nthings in question. For if both pleasure and pain belonged to the class of\nevils they ought both to be objects of aversion, while if they belonged to\nthe class of neutrals neither should be an object of aversion or they\nshould both be equally so; but in fact people evidently avoid the one as\nevil and choose the other as good; that then must be the nature of the\nopposition between them.",

    "text": "Nor again, if pleasure is not a quality, does it follow that it is not a good;\nfor the activities of virtue are not qualities either, nor is happiness. They\nsay, however, that the good is determinate, while pleasure is indetermi-\nnate, because it admits of degrees. Now if it is from the feeling of plea-\nsure that they judge thus, the same will be true of justice and the other\nvirtues, in respect of which we plainly say that people of a certain char-\nacter are so more or less, and act more or less in accordance with these\nvirtues; for people may be more just or brave, and it is possible also to\nact justly or temperately more or less. But if their judgement is based on\nthe various pleasures, surely they are not stating the real cause, if in fact\nsome pleasures are unmixed and others mixed. Again, just as health\nadmits of degrees without being indeterminate, why should not plea-\nsure? The same proportion is not found in all things, nor a single pro-\nportion always in the same thing, but it may be relaxed and yet persist\nup to a point, and it may differ in degree. The case of pleasure also may\ntherefore be of this kind.\nAgain, they assume that the good is perfect while movements and\ncomings into being are imperfect, and try to exhibit pleasure as being a\nmovement and a coming into being. But they do not seem to be right\neven in saying that it is a movement. For speed and slowness are thought\nto be proper to every movement, and if a movement, e.g., that of the\nheavens, has not speed or slowness in itself, it has it in relation to some-\nthing else; but of pleasure neither of these things is true. For while we\nmay become pleased quickly as we may become angry quickly, we can-\nnot be pleased quickly, not even in relation to some one else, while we\ncan walk, or grow, or the like, quickly. While, then, we can change\nquickly or slowly into a state of pleasure, we cannot quickly exhibit the\nactivity of pleasure, i.e., be pleased. Again, how can it be a coming into\nbeing? It is not thought that any chance thing can come out of any chance\nthing, but that a thing is dissolved into that out of which it comes into\nbeing; and pain would be the destruction of that of which pleasure is the\ncoming into being.\nThey say, too, that pain is the lack of that which is according to\nnature, and pleasure is replenishment. But these experiences are bodily.\nIf then pleasure is replenishment with that which is according to nature,\nthat which feels pleasure will be that in which the replenishment takes\nplace, i.e., the body; but that is not thought to be the case; therefore the\nreplenishment is not pleasure, though one would be pleased when re-\nplenishment was taking place, just as one would be pained if one was\nbeing operated on. This opinion seems to be based on the pains and\npleasures connected with nutrition; on the fact that when people have\nbeen short of food and have felt pain beforehand they are pleased by the\nreplenishment. But this does not happen with all pleasures; for the plea-\nsures of learning and, among the sensuous pleasures, those of smell,\nand also many sounds and sights, and memories and hopes, do not pre-\nsuppose pain. Of what then will these be the coming into being? There\nhas not been lack of anything of which they could be the supplying\nanew.\nIn reply to those who bring forward the disgraceful pleasures one\nmay say that these are not pleasant; if things are pleasant to people of\nvicious constitution, we must not suppose that they are also pleasant to\nothers than these, just as we do not reason so about the things that are\nwholesome or sweet or bitter to sick people, or ascribe whiteness to the\nthings that seem white to those suffering from a disease of the eye. Or\none might answer thus—that the pleasures are desirable, but not from\nthese sources, as wealth is desirable, but not as the reward of betrayal,\nand health, but not at the cost of eating anything and everything. Or\nperhaps pleasures differ in kind; for those derived from noble sources\nare different from those derived from base sources, and one cannot the\npleasure of the just man without being just, nor that of the musical man\nwithout being musical, and so on.\nThe fact, too, that a friend is different from a flatterer seems to\nmake it plain that pleasure is not a good or that pleasures are different in\nkind; for the one is thought to consort with us with a view to the good,\nthe other with a view to our pleasure, and the one is reproached for his\nconduct while the other is praised on the ground that he consorts with us\nfor different ends. And no one would choose to live with the intellect of\na child throughout his life, however much he were to be pleased at the\nthings that children are pleased at, nor to get enjoyment by doing some\nmost disgraceful deed, though he were never to feel any pain in conse-\nquence. And there are many things we should be keen about even if they\nbrought no pleasure, e.g., seeing, remembering, knowing, possessing\nthe virtues. If pleasures necessarily do accompany these, that makes no\nodds; we should choose these even if no pleasure resulted. It seems to be\nclear, then, that neither is pleasure the good nor is all pleasure desirable,\nand that some pleasures are desirable in themselves, differing in kind or\nin their sources from the others. So much for the things that are said\nabout pleasure and pain.",

    "text": "What pleasure is, or what kind of thing it is, will become plainer if we\ntake up the question aga from the beginning. Seeing seems to be at any\nmoment complete, for it does not lack anything which coming into being\nlater will complete its form; and pleasure also seems to be of this nature.\nFor it is a whole, and at no time can one find a pleasure whose form will\nbe completed if the pleasure lasts longer. For this reason, too, it is not a\nmovement. For every movement (e.g., that of building) takes time and is\nfor the sake of an end, and is complete when it has made what it aims at.\nIt is complete, therefore, only in the whole time or at that final moment.\nIn their parts and during the time they occupy, all movements are in-\ncomplete, and are different in kind from the whole movement and from\neach other. For the fitting together of the stones is different from the\nfluting of the column, and these are both different from the making of\nthe temple; and the making of the temple is complete (for it lacks noth-\ning with a view to the end proposed), but the making of the base or of\nthe triglyph is incomplete; for each is the making of only a part. They\ndiffer in kind, then, and it is not possible to find at any and every time a\nmovement complete in form, but if at all, only in the whole time. So,\ntoo, in the case of walking and all other movements. For if locomotion is\na movement from to there, it, too, has differences in kind—flying, walk-\ning, leaping, and so on. And not only so, but in walking itself there are\nsuch differences; for the whence and whither are not the same in the\nwhole racecourse and in a part of it, nor in one part and in another, nor\nis it the same thing to traverse this line and that; for one traverses not\nonly a line but one which is in a place, and this one is in a different place\nfrom that. We have discussed movement with precision in another work,\nbut it seems that it is not complete at any and every time, but that the\nmany movements are incomplete and different in kind, since the whence\nand whither give them their form. But of pleasure the form is complete\nat any and every time. Plainly, then, pleasure and movement must be\ndifferent from each other, and pleasure must be one of the things that are\nwhole and complete. This would seem to be the case, too, from the fact\nthat it is not possible to move otherwise than in time, but it is possible to\nbe pleased; for that which takes place in a moment is a whole.\nFrom these considerations it is clear, too, that these thinkers are not\nright in saying there is a movement or a coming into being of pleasure.\nFor these cannot be ascribed to all things, but only to those that are\ndivisible and not wholes; there is no coming into being of seeing nor of\na point nor of a unit, nor is any of these a movement or coming into\nbeing; therefore there is no movement or coming into being of pleasure\neither; for it is a whole.\nSince every sense is active in relation to its object, and a sense\nwhich is in good condition acts perfectly in relation to the most beautiful\nof its objects (for perfect activity seems to be ideally of this nature;\nwhether we say that it is active, or the organ in which it resides, may be\nassumed to be immaterial), it follows that in the case of each sense the\nbest activity is that of the best-conditioned organ in relation to the finest\nof its objects. And this activity will be the most complete and pleasant.\nFor, while there is pleasure in respect of any sense, and in respect of\nthought and contemplation no less, the most complete is pleasantest,\nand that of a well-conditioned organ in relation to the worthiest of its\nobjects is the most complete; and the pleasure completes the activity.\nBut the pleasure does not complete it in the same way as the combina-\ntion of object and sense, both good, just as health and the doctor are not\nin the same way the cause of a man’s being healthy. (That pleasure is\nproduced in respect to each sense is plain; for we speak of sights and\nsounds as pleasant. It is also plain that it arises most of all when both\nthe sense is at its best and it is active in reference to an object which\ncorresponds; when both object and perceiver are of the best there will\nalways be pleasure, since the requisite agent and patient are both present.)\nPleasure completes the activity not as the corresponding permanent state\ndoes, by its immanence, but as an end which supervenes as the bloom of\nyouth does on those in the flower of their age. So long, then, as both the\nintelligible or sensible object and the discriminating or contemplative\nfaculty are as they should be, the pleasure will be involved in the activ-\nity; for when both the passive and the active factor are unchanged and\nare related to each other in the same way, the same result naturally\nfollows.\nHow, then, is it that no one is continuously pleased? Is it that we\ngrow weary? Certainly all human beings are incapable of continuous\nactivity. Therefore pleasure also is not continuous; for it accompanies\nactivity. Some things delight us when they are new, but later do so less,\nfor the same reason; for at first the mind is in a state of stimulation and\nintensely active about them, as people are with respect to their vision\nwhen they look hard at a thing, but afterwards our activity is not of this\nkind, but has grown relaxed; for which reason the pleasure also is dulled.\nOne might think that all men desire pleasure because they all aim at\nlife; life is an activity, and each man is active about those things and\nwith those faculties that he loves most; e.g., the musician is active with\nhis hearing in reference to tunes, the student with his mind in reference\nto theoretical questions, and so on in each case; now pleasure completes\nthe activities, and therefore life, which they desire. It is with good rea-\nson, then, that they aim at pleasure too, since for every one it completes\nlife, which is desirable. But whether we choose life for the sake of plea-\nsure or pleasure for the sake of life is a question we may dismiss for the\npresent. For they seem to be bound up together and not to admit of\nseparation, since without activity pleasure does not arise, and every\nactivity is completed by the attendant pleasure.",

    "text": "For this reason pleasures seem, too, to differ in kind. For things differ-\nent in kind are, we think, completed by different things (we see this to be\ntrue both of natural objects and of things produced by art, e.g., animals,\ntrees, a painting, a sculpture, a house, an implement); and, similarly, we\nthink that activities differing in kind are completed by things differing in\nkind. Now the activities of thought differ from those of the senses, and\nboth differ among themselves, in kind; so, therefore, do the pleasures\nthat complete them.\nThis may be seen, too, from the fact that each of the pleasures is\nbound up with the activity it completes. For an activity is intensified by\nits proper pleasure, since each class of things is better judged of and\nbrought to precision by those who engage in the activity with pleasure;\ne.g., it is those who enjoy geometrical thinking that become geometers\nand grasp the various propositions better, and, similarly, those who are\nfond of music or of building, and so on, make progress in their proper\nfunction by enjoying it; so the pleasures intensify the activities, and\nwhat intensifies a thing is proper to it, but things different in kind have\nproperties different in kind.\nThis will be even more apparent from the fact that activities are\nhindered by pleasures arising from other sources. For people who are\nfond of playing the flute are incapable of attending to arguments if they\noverhear some one playing the flute, since they enjoy flute-playing more\nthan the activity in hand; so the pleasure connected with fluteplaying\ndestroys the activity concerned with argument. This happens, similarly,\nin all other cases, when one is active about two things at once; the more\npleasant activity drives out the other, and if it is much more pleasant\ndoes so all the more, so that one even ceases from the other. This is why\nwhen we enjoy anything very much we do not throw ourselves into any-\nthing else, and do one thing only when we are not much pleased by\nanother; e.g., in the theatre the people who eat sweets do so most when\nthe actors are poor. Now since activities are made precise and more\nenduring and better by their proper pleasure, and injured by alien plea-\nsures, evidently the two kinds of pleasure are far apart. For alien plea-\nsures do pretty much what proper pains do, since activities are destroyed\nby their proper pains; e.g., if a man finds writing or doing sums un-\npleasant and painful, he does not write, or does not do sums, because\nthe activity is painful. So an activity suffers contrary effects from its\nproper pleasures and pains, i.e., from those that supervene on it in virtue\nof its own nature. And alien pleasures have been stated to do much the\nsame as pain; they destroy the activity, only not to the same degree.\nNow since activities differ in respect of goodness and badness, and\nsome are worthy to be chosen, others to be avoided, and others neutral,\nso, too, are the pleasures; for to each activity there is a proper pleasure.\nThe pleasure proper to a worthy activity is good and that proper to an\nunworthy activity bad; just as the appetites for noble objects are laud-\nable, those for base objects culpable. But the pleasures involved in ac-\ntivities are more proper to them than the desires; for the latter are sepa-\nrated both in time and in nature, while the former are close to the activi-\nties, and so hard to distinguish from them that it admits of dispute whether\nthe activity is not the same as the pleasure. (Still, pleasure does not\nseem to be thought or perception—that would be strange; but because\nthey are not found apart they appear to some people the same.) As ac-\ntivities are different, then, so are the corresponding pleasures. Now sight\nis superior to touch in purity, and hearing and smell to taste; the plea-\nsures, therefore, are similarly superior, and those of thought superior to\nthese, and within each of the two kinds some are superior to others.\nEach animal is thought to have a proper pleasure, as it has a proper\nfunction; viz. that which corresponds to its activity. If we survey them\nspecies by species, too, this will be evident; horse, dog, and man have\ndifferent pleasures, as Heraclitus says ‘asses would prefer sweepings to\ngold’; for food is pleasanter than gold to asses. So the pleasures of\ncreatures different in kind differ in kind, and it is plausible to suppose\nthat those of a single species do not differ. But they vary to no small\nextent, in the case of men at least; the same things delight some people\nand pain others, and are painful and odious to some, and pleasant to and\nliked by others. This happens, too, in the case of sweet things; the same\nthings do not seem sweet to a man in a fever and a healthy man—nor hot\nto a weak man and one in good condition. The same happens in other\ncases. But in all such matters that which appears to the good man is\nthought to be really so. If this is correct, as it seems to be, and virtue and\nthe good man as such are the measure of each thing, those also will be\npleasures which appear so to him, and those things pleasant which he\nenjoys. If the things he finds tiresome seem pleasant to some one, that is\nnothing surprising; for men may be ruined and spoilt in many ways; but\nthe things are not pleasant, but only pleasant to these people and to\npeople in this condition. Those which are admittedly disgraceful plainly\nshould not be said to be pleasures, except to a perverted taste; but of\nthose that are thought to be good what kind of pleasure or what pleasure\nshould be said to be that proper to man? Is it not plain from the corre-\nsponding activities? The pleasures follow these. Whether, then, the per-\nfect and supremely happy man has one or more activities, the pleasures\nthat perfect these will be said in the strict sense to be pleasures proper to\nman, and the rest will be so in a secondary and fractional way, as are the\nactivities.",

    "text": "Now that we have spoken of the virtues, the forms of friendship, and the\nvarieties of pleasure, what remains is to discuss in outline the nature of\nhappiness, since this is what we state the end of human nature to be.\nOur discussion will be the more concise if we first sum up what we have\nsaid already. We said, then, that it is not a disposition; for if it were it\nmight belong to some one who was asleep throughout his life, living the\nlife of a plant, or, again, to some one who was suffering the greatest\nmisfortunes. If these implications are unacceptable, and we must rather\nclass happiness as an activity, as we have said before, and if some ac-\ntivities are necessary, and desirable for the sake of something else, while\nothers are so in themselves, evidently happiness must be placed among\nthose desirable in themselves, not among those desirable for the sake of\nsomething else; for happiness does not lack anything, but is self-suffi-\ncient. Now those activities are desirable in themselves from which noth-\ning is sought beyond the activity. And of this nature virtuous actions are\nthought to be; for to do noble and good deeds is a thing desirable for its\nown sake.\nPleasant amusements also are thought to be of this nature; we choose\nthem not for the sake of other things; for we are injured rather than\nbenefited by them, since we are led to neglect our bodies and our prop-\nerty. But most of the people who are deemed happy take refuge in such\npastimes, which is the reason why those who are ready-witted at them\nare highly esteemed at the courts of tyrants; they make themselves pleas-\nant companions in the tyrants’ favourite pursuits, and that is the sort of\nman they want. Now these things are thought to be of the nature of\nhappiness because people in despotic positions spend their leisure in\nthem, but perhaps such people prove nothing; for virtue and reason,\nfrom which good activities flow, do not depend on despotic position;\nnor, if these people, who have never tasted pure and generous pleasure,\ntake refuge in the bodily pleasures, should these for that reason be thought\nmore desirable; for boys, too, think the things that are valued among\nthemselves are the best. It is to be expected, then, that, as different things\nseem valuable to boys and to men, so they should to bad men and to\ngood. Now, as we have often maintained, those things are both valuable\nand pleasant which are such to the good man; and to each man the\nactivity in accordance with his own disposition is most desirable, and,\ntherefore, to the good man that which is in accordance with virtue. Hap-\npiness, therefore, does not lie in amusement; it would, indeed, be strange\nif the end were amusement, and one were to take trouble and suffer\nhardship all one’s life in order to amuse oneself. For, in a word, every-\nthing that we choose we choose for the sake of something else—except\nhappiness, which is an end. Now to exert oneself and work for the sake\nof amusement seems silly and utterly childish. But to amuse oneself in\norder that one may exert oneself, as Anacharsis puts it, seems right; for\namusement is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we\ncannot work continuously. Relaxation, then, is not an end; for it is taken\nfor the sake of activity.\nThe happy life is thought to be virtuous; now a virtuous life re-\nquires exertion, and does not consist in amusement. And we say that\nserious things are better than laughable things and those connected with\namusement, and that the activity of the better of any two things—whether\nit be two elements of our being or two men—is the more serious; but the\nactivity of the better is ipso facto superior and more of the nature of\nhappiness. And any chance person—even a slave—can enjoy the bodily\npleasures no less than the best man; but no one assigns to a slave a share\nin happiness—unless he assigns to him also a share in human life. For\nhappiness does not lie in such occupations, but, as we have said before,\nin virtuous activities.",

    "text": "If happiness is activity in accordance with virtue, it is reasonable that it\nshould be in accordance with the highest virtue; and this will be that of\nthe best thing in us. Whether it be reason or something else that is this\nelement which is thought to be our natural ruler and guide and to take\nthought of things noble and divine, whether it be itself also divine or\nonly the most divine element in us, the activity of this in accordance\nwith its proper virtue will be perfect happiness. That this activity is\ncontemplative we have already said.\nNow this would seem to be in agreement both with what we said\nbefore and with the truth. For, firstly, this activity is the best (since not\nonly is reason the best thing in us, but the objects of reason are the best\nof knowable objects); and secondly, it is the most continuous, since we\ncan contemplate truth more continuously than we can do anything. And\nwe think happiness has pleasure mingled with it, but the activity of\nphilosophic wisdom is admittedly the pleasantest of virtuous activities;\nat all events the pursuit of it is thought to offer pleasures marvellous for\ntheir purity and their enduringness, and it is to be expected that those\nwho know will pass their time more pleasantly than those who inquire.\nAnd the self-sufficiency that is spoken of must belong most to the con-\ntemplative activity. For while a philosopher, as well as a just man or one\npossessing any other virtue, needs the necessaries of life, when they are\nsufficiently equipped with things of that sort the just man needs people\ntowards whom and with whom he shall act justly, and the temperate\nman, the brave man, and each of the others is in the same case, but the\nphilosopher, even when by himself, can contemplate truth, and the bet-\nter the wiser he is; he can perhaps do so better if he has fellow-workers,\nbut still he is the most self-sufficient. And this activity alone would\nseem to be loved for its own sake; for nothing arises from it apart from\nthe contemplating, while from practical activities we gain more or less\napart from the action. And happiness is thought to depend on leisure;\nfor we are busy that we may have leisure, and make war that we may\nlive in peace. Now the activity of the practical virtues is exhibited in\npolitical or military affairs, but the actions concerned with these seem to\nbe unleisurely. Warlike actions are completely so (for no one chooses to\nbe at war, or provokes war, for the sake of being at war; any one would\nseem absolutely murderous if he were to make enemies of his friends in\norder to bring about battle and slaughter); but the action of the states-\nman is also unleisurely, and—apart from the political action itself—\naims at despotic power and honours, or at all events happiness, for him\nand his fellow citizens—a happiness different from political action, and\nevidently sought as being different. So if among virtuous actions politi-\ncal and military actions are distinguished by nobility and greatness, and\nthese are unleisurely and aim at an end and are not desirable for their\nown sake, but the activity of reason, which is contemplative, seems both\nto be superior in serious worth and to aim at no end beyond itself, and to\nhave its pleasure proper to itself (and this augments the activity), and\nthe self-sufficiency, leisureliness, unweariedness (so far as this is pos-\nsible for man), and all the other attributes ascribed to the supremely\nhappy man are evidently those connected with this activity, it follows\nthat this will be the complete happiness of man, if it be allowed a com-\nplete term of life (for none of the attributes of happiness is incomplete).\nBut such a life would be too high for man; for it is not in so far as he\nis man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine is present in\nhim; and by so much as this is superior to our composite nature is its\nactivity superior to that which is the exercise of the other kind of virtue.\nIf reason is divine, then, in comparison with man, the life according to it\nis divine in comparison with human life. But we must not follow those\nwho advise us, being men, to think of human things, and, being mortal,\nof mortal things, but must, so far as we can, make ourselves immortal,\nand strain every nerve to live in accordance with the best thing in us; for\neven if it be small in bulk, much more does it in power and worth sur-\npass everything. This would seem, too, to be each man himself, since it\nis the authoritative and better part of him. It would be strange, then, if\nhe were to choose not the life of his self but that of something else. And\nwhat we said before’ will apply now; that which is proper to each thing\nis by nature best and most pleasant for each thing; for man, therefore,\nthe life according to reason is best and pleasantest, since reason more\nthan anything else is man. This life therefore is also the happiest.",

    "text": "But in a secondary degree the life in accordance with the other kind of\nvirtue is happy; for the activities in accordance with this befit our hu-\nman estate. Just and brave acts, and other virtuous acts, we do in rela-\ntion to each other, observing our respective duties with regard to con-\ntracts and services and all manner of actions and with regard to pas-\nsions; and all of these seem to be typically human. Some of them seem\neven to arise from the body, and virtue of character to be in many ways\nbound up with the passions. Practical wisdom, too, is linked to virtue of\ncharacter, and this to practical wisdom, since the principles of practical\nwisdom are in accordance with the moral virtues and rightness in mor-\nals is in accordance with practical wisdom. Being connected with the\npassions also, the moral virtues must belong to our composite nature;\nand the virtues of our composite nature are human; so, therefore, are the\nlife and the happiness which correspond to these. The excellence of the\nreason is a thing apart; we must be content to say this much about it, for\nto describe it precisely is a task greater than our purpose requires. It\nwould seem, however, also to need external equipment but little, or less\nthan moral virtue does. Grant that both need the necessaries, and do so\nequally, even if the statesman’s work is the more concerned with the\nbody and things of that sort; for there will be little difference there; but\nin what they need for the exercise of their activities there will be much\ndifference. The liberal man will need money for the doing of his liberal\ndeeds, and the just man too will need it for the returning of services (for\nwishes are hard to discern, and even people who are not just pretend to\nwish to act justly); and the brave man will need power if he is to accom-\nplish any of the acts that correspond to his virtue, and the temperate\nman will need opportunity; for how else is either he or any of the others\nto be recognized? It is debated, too, whether the will or the deed is more\nessential to virtue, which is assumed to involve both; it is surely clear\nthat its perfection involves both; but for deeds many things are needed,\nand more, the greater and nobler the deeds are. But the man who is\ncontemplating the truth needs no such thing, at least with a view to the\nexercise of his activity; indeed they are, one may say, even hindrances,\nat all events to his contemplation; but in so far as he is a man and lives\nwith a number of people, he chooses to do virtuous acts; he will there-\nfore need such aids to living a human life.\nBut that perfect happiness is a contemplative activity will appear\nfrom the following consideration as well. We assume the gods to be\nabove all other beings blessed and happy; but what sort of actions must\nwe assign to them? Acts of justice? Will not the gods seem absurd if\nthey make contracts and return deposits, and so on? Acts of a brave\nman, then, confronting dangers and running risks because it is noble to\ndo so? Or liberal acts? To whom will they give? It will be strange if they\nare really to have money or anything of the kind. And what would their\ntemperate acts be? Is not such praise tasteless, since they have no bad\nappetites? If we were to run through them all, the circumstances of\naction would be found trivial and unworthy of gods. Still, every one\nsupposes that they live and therefore that they are active; we cannot\nsuppose them to sleep like Endymion. Now if you take away from a\nliving being action, and still more production, what is left but contem-\nplation? Therefore the activity of God, which surpasses all others in\nblessedness, must be contemplative; and of human activities, therefore,\nthat which is most akin to this must be most of the nature of happiness.\nThis is indicated, too, by the fact that the other animals have no\nshare in happiness, being completely deprived of such activity. For while\nthe whole life of the gods is blessed, and that of men too in so far as\nsome likeness of such activity belongs to them, none of the other ani-\nmals is happy, since they in no way share in contemplation. Happiness\nextends, then, just so far as contemplation does, and those to whom\ncontemplation more fully belongs are more truly happy, not as a mere\nconcomitant but in virtue of the contemplation; for this is in itself pre-\ncious. Happiness, therefore, must be some form of contemplation.\nBut, being a man, one will also need external prosperity; for our\nnature is not self-sufficient for the purpose of contemplation, but our\nbody also must be healthy and must have food and other attention. Still,\nwe must not think that the man who is to be happy will need many things\nor great things, merely because he cannot be supremely happy without\nexternal goods; for self-sufficiency and action do not involve excess,\nand we can do noble acts without ruling earth and sea; for even with\nmoderate advantages one can act virtuously (this is manifest enough;\nfor private persons are thought to do worthy acts no less than despots—\nindeed even more); and it is enough that we should have so much as\nthat; for the life of the man who is active in accordance with virtue will\nbe happy. Solon, too, was perhaps sketching well the happy man when\nhe described him as moderately furnished with externals but as having\ndone (as Solon thought) the noblest acts, and lived temperately; for one\ncan with but moderate possessions do what one ought. Anaxagoras also\nseems to have supposed the happy man not to be rich nor a despot, when\nhe said that he would not be surprised if the happy man were to seem to\nmost people a strange person; for they judge by externals, since these\nare all they perceive. The opinions of the wise seem, then, to harmonize\nwith our arguments. But while even such things carry some conviction,\nthe truth in practical matters is discerned from the facts of life; for these\nare the decisive factor. We must therefore survey what we have already\nsaid, bringing it to the test of the facts of life, and if it harmonizes with\nthe facts we must accept it, but if it clashes with them we must suppose\nit to be mere theory. Now he who exercises his reason and cultivates it\nseems to be both in the best state of mind and most dear to the gods. For\nif the gods have any care for human affairs, as they are thought to have,\nit would be reasonable both that they should delight in that which was\nbest and most akin to them (i.e., reason) and that they should reward\nthose who love and honour this most, as caring for the things that are\ndear to them and acting both rightly and nobly. And that all these at-\ntributes belong most of all to the philosopher is manifest. He, therefore,\nis the dearest to the gods. And he who is that will presumably be also the\nhappiest; so that in this way too the philosopher will more than any\nother be happy.",

    "text": "If these matters and the virtues, and also friendship and pleasure, have\nbeen dealt with sufficiently in outline, are we to suppose that our\nprogramme has reached its end? Surely, as the saying goes, where there\nare things to be done the end is not to survey and recognize the various\nthings, but rather to do them; with regard to virtue, then, it is not enough\nto know, but we must try to have and use it, or try any other way there\nmay be of becoming good. Now if arguments were in themselves enough\nto make men good, they would justly, as Theognis says, have won very\ngreat rewards, and such rewards should have been provided; but as\nthings are, while they seem to have power to encourage and stimulate\nthe generous-minded among our youth, and to make a character which\nis gently born, and a true lover of what is noble, ready to be possessed\nby virtue, they are not able to encourage the many to nobility and good-\nness. For these do not by nature obey the sense of shame, but only fear,\nand do not abstain from bad acts because of their baseness but through\nfear of punishment; living by passion they pursue their own pleasures\nand the means to them, and and the opposite pains, and have not even a\nconception of what is noble and truly pleasant, since they have never\ntasted it. What argument would remould such people? It is hard, if not\nimpossible, to remove by argument the traits that have long since been\nincorporated in the character; and perhaps we must be content if, when\nall the influences by which we are thought to become good are present,\nwe get some tincture of virtue.\nNow some think that we are made good by nature, others by habitu-\nation, others by teaching. Nature’s part evidently does not depend on us,\nbut as a result of some divine causes is present in those who are truly\nfortunate; while argument and teaching, we may suspect, are not pow-\nerful with all men, but the soul of the student must first have been culti-\nvated by means of habits for noble joy and noble hatred, like earth which\nis to nourish the seed. For he who lives as passion directs will not hear\nargument that dissuades him, nor understand it if he does; and how can\nwe persuade one in such a state to change his ways? And in general\npassion seems to yield not to argument but to force. The character, then,\nmust somehow be there already with a kinship to virtue, loving what is\nnoble and hating what is base.\nBut it is difficult to get from youth up a right training for virtue if\none has not been brought up under right laws; for to live temperately\nand hardily is not pleasant to most people, especially when they are\nyoung. For this reason their nurture and occupations should be fixed by\nlaw; for they will not be painful when they have become customary. But\nit is surely not enough that when they are young they should get the right\nnurture and attention; since they must, even when they are grown up,\npractise and be habituated to them, we shall need laws for this as well,\nand generally speaking to cover the whole of life; for most people obey\nnecessity rather than argument, and punishments rather than the sense\nof what is noble.\nThis is why some think that legislators ought to stimulate men to\nvirtue and urge them forward by the motive of the noble, on the assump-\ntion that those who have been well advanced by the formation of habits\nwill attend to such influences; and that punishments and penalties should\nbe imposed on those who disobey and are of inferior nature, while the\nincurably bad should be completely banished. A good man (they think),\nsince he lives with his mind fixed on what is noble, will submit to argu-\nment, while a bad man, whose desire is for pleasure, is corrected by\npain like a beast of burden. This is, too, why they say the pains inflicted\nshould be those that are most opposed to the pleasures such men love.\nHowever that may be, if (as we have said) the man who is to be\ngood must be well trained and habituated, and go on to spend his time in\nworthy occupations and neither willingly nor unwillingly do bad ac-\ntions, and if this can be brought about if men live in accordance with a\nsort of reason and right order, provided this has force,—if this be so, the\npaternal command indeed has not the required force or compulsive power\n(nor in general has the command of one man, unless he be a king or\nsomething similar), but the law has compulsive power, while it is at the\nsame time a rule proceeding from a sort of practical wisdom and reason.\nAnd while people hate men who oppose their impulses, even if they\noppose them rightly, the law in its ordaining of what is good is not\nburdensome.\nIn the Spartan state alone, or almost alone, the legislator seems to\nhave paid attention to questions of nurture and occupations; in most\nstates such matters have been neglected, and each man lives as he pleases,\nCyclops-fashion, ‘to his own wife and children dealing law’. Now it is\nbest that there should be a public and proper care for such matters; but\nif they are neglected by the community it would seem right for each man\nto help his children and friends towards virtue, and that they should\nhave the power, or at least the will, to do this.\nIt would seem from what has been said that he can do this better if\nhe makes himself capable of legislating. For public control is plainly\neffected by laws, and good control by good laws; whether written or\nunwritten would seem to make no difference, nor whether they are laws\nproviding for the education of individuals or of groups—any more than\nit does in the case of music or gymnastics and other such pursuits. For\nas in cities laws and prevailing types of character have force, so in\nhouseholds do the injunctions and the habits of the father, and these\nhave even more because of the tie of blood and the benefits he confers;\nfor the children start with a natural affection and disposition to obey.\nFurther, private education has an advantage over public, as private\nmedical treatment has; for while in general rest and abstinence from\nfood are good for a man in a fever, for a particular man they may not be;\nand a boxer presumably does not prescribe the same style of fighting to\nall his pupils. It would seem, then, that the detail is worked out with\nmore precision if the control is private; for each person is more likely to\nget what suits his case.\nBut the details can be best looked after, one by one, by a doctor or\ngymnastic instructor or any one else who has the general knowledge of\nwhat is good for every one or for people of a certain kind (for the sci-\nences both are said to be, and are, concerned with what is universal);\nnot but what some particular detail may perhaps be well looked after by\nan unscientific person, if he has studied accurately in the light of expe-\nrience what happens in each case, just as some people seem to be their\nown best doctors, though they could give no help to any one else. None\nthe less, it will perhaps be agreed that if a man does wish to become\nmaster of an art or science he must go to the universal, and come to\nknow it as well as possible; for, as we have said, it is with this that the\nsciences are concerned.\nAnd surely he who wants to make men, whether many or few, better\nby his care must try to become capable of legislating, if it is through\nlaws that we can become good. For to get any one whatever—any one\nwho is put before us—into the right condition is not for the first chance\ncomer; if any one can do it, it is the man who knows, just as in medicine\nand all other matters which give scope for care and prudence.\nMust we not, then, next examine whence or how one can learn how\nto legislate? Is it, as in all other cases, from statesmen? Certainly it was\nthought to be a part of statesmanship. Or is a difference apparent be-\ntween statesmanship and the other sciences and arts? In the others the\nsame people are found offering to teach the arts and practising them,\ne.g., doctors or painters; but while the sophists profess to teach politics,\nit is practised not by any of them but by the politicians, who would seem\nto do so by dint of a certain skill and experience rather than of thought;\nfor they are not found either writing or speaking about such matters\n(though it were a nobler occupation perhaps than composing speeches\nfor the law-courts and the assembly), nor again are they found to have\nmade statesmen of their own sons or any other of their friends. But it\nwas to be expected that they should if they could; for there is nothing\nbetter than such a skill that they could have left to their cities, or could\nprefer to have for themselves, or, therefore, for those dearest to them.\nStill, experience seems to contribute not a little; else they could not have\nbecome politicians by familiarity with politics; and so it seems that those\nwho aim at knowing about the art of politics need experience as well.\nBut those of the sophists who profess the art seem to be very far\nfrom teaching it. For, to put the matter generally, they do not even know\nwhat kind of thing it is nor what kinds of things it is about; otherwise\nthey would not have classed it as identical with rhetoric or even inferior\nto it, nor have thought it easy to legislate by collecting the laws that are\nthought well of; they say it is possible to select the best laws, as though\neven the selection did not demand intelligence and as though right judge-\nment were not the greatest thing, as in matters of music. For while people\nexperienced in any department judge rightly the works produced in it,\nand understand by what means or how they are achieved, and what\nharmonizes with what, the inexperienced must be content if they do not\nfail to see whether the work has been well or ill made—as in the case of\npainting. Now laws are as it were the ‘works’ of the political art; how\nthen can one learn from them to be a legislator, or judge which are best?\nEven medical men do not seem to be made by a study of text-books. Yet\npeople try, at any rate, to state not only the treatments, but also how\nparticular classes of people can be cured and should be treated—distin-\nguishing the various habits of body; but while this seems useful to expe-\nrienced people, to the inexperienced it is valueless. Surely, then, while\ncollections of laws, and of constitutions also, may be serviceable to\nthose who can study them and judge what is good or bad and what\nenactments suit what circumstances, those who go through such collec-\ntions without a practised faculty will not have right judgement (unless it\nbe as a spontaneous gift of nature), though they may perhaps become\nmore intelligent in such matters.\nNow our predecessors have left the subject of legislation to us\nunexamined; it is perhaps best, therefore, that we should ourselves study\nit, and in general study the question of the constitution, in order to com-\nplete to the best of our ability our philosophy of human nature. First,\nthen, if anything has been said well in detail by earlier thinkers, let us try\nto review it; then in the light of the constitutions we have collected let us\nstudy what sorts of influence preserve and destroy states, and what sorts\npreserve or destroy the particular kinds of constitution, and to what\ncauses it is due that some are well and others ill administered. When\nthese have been studied we shall perhaps be more likely to see with a\ncomprehensive view, which constitution is best, and how each must be\nordered, and what laws and customs it must use, if it is to be at its best.\nLet us make a beginning of our discussion.\nTHE END",
